# Session Forking

Forking copies a Jean session's history into a new session that the user can continue
from, without touching the source. There are three shapes, all sharing one core in
`jean-core/src/chat/fork.rs`.

| Shape              | Command                                             | Working directory                                                      | History   |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| **New worktree**   | `fork_session_to_worktree` (`projects/commands.rs`) | a new git worktree at the source HEAD, with the dirty tree copied over | all runs  |
| **Same worktree**  | `fork_session_in_place` (`chat/fork.rs`)            | the source's, shared                                                   | all runs  |
| **From a message** | `fork_session_in_place` with `fromMessageId`        | the source's, shared                                                   | truncated |

Entry points: the session context menu (`SessionContextMenuItems.tsx`, both worktree
shapes), the message right-click menu (`message-thread-context-menu.tsx`, "Fork from
here"), the Magic modal (`H` same worktree, `W` new worktree), and the mobile toolbar
menu. All of them go through `useSessionFork()`.

## What gets copied

- `metadata.json` — the whole record, with `runs` replaced by the kept list.
- `{run_id}.jsonl` for each kept run. `{run_id}.input.jsonl` is **not** copied; it is a
  consumed stdin payload that the source deletes after its run.
- Attached saved contexts (`session-context/{session_id}-context-*.md`) and the
  GitHub/Linear/Sentry/advisory references in `git-context/references.json`. These key
  off the session id, so without an explicit copy a fork would silently lose them.
  Both are best effort — the fork has already succeeded when they run.
- Backend, model, thinking/effort level, provider and execution mode, via `Session::clone()`.

## What gets cleared

`clear_session_runtime_state` and `prepare_forked_metadata` drop every backend resume id
(except the one a native fork reuses, below), every pending approval queue,
`queued_messages`, `scheduled_wakeup` and the `last_run_*` fields.

A fork also drops `started_by_session_id` (the MCP parent link, see
`chat/session_links.rs`): the source's parent did not start the fork. The fork's link is
`forked_from_session_id`, which the chat shows as "Forked from ‘…’".

`sanitize_forked_run` strips per-run state that only made sense in the source:

- `checkpoint_id` — points into the **source worktree's** `ai-checkpoints/{worktree_id}.json`.
  A restore from the fork would revert against a snapshot the fork never took.
- `pid` and `codex_turn_id` — describe the source's processes and in-flight turns.
- A `Running` or `Resumable` status becomes `Crashed`. `run_log::start_run` refuses a
  second concurrent `Running` run, so without this the fork's very first send would fail.

## Forking while a turn runs

A fork is allowed while the source session runs. `drop_in_flight_run` removes the last
run when it is `Running` or `Resumable`, so the fork starts from the last finished turn
and never shows a half-written answer. The source turn is not touched.

When a run was dropped, both fork shapes pass `truncated = true` to `fork_strategy`, so
a Claude fork takes the handoff path: Claude's own transcript already holds the
half-finished turn, and `--fork-session` would branch from it.

## Truncating at a message

`truncate_runs_at_message(runs, message_id)` decides what the fork inherits:

- `None` — every run.
- an **assistant** message id — that run is kept, so the fork ends with that answer.
- a **user** message id — that run and everything after it is dropped, so the fork ends
  just before that prompt and the user can ask something different there.

A message id that matches no run is an error rather than a silent full fork.

## Regaining the backend's context

A fork shows history the backend has no record of. `PendingFork`, stored on
`SessionMetadata.pending_fork`, records how the fork's **first send** closes that gap.
`run_log::complete` clears it in the same atomic write that records the finished run,
so it fires exactly once per turn that actually ran. A cancelled or crashed first turn
keeps it, and the retry forks again — clearing it at the _start_ would drop
`--fork-session` while the source's resume id is still on the session, and the next
send would append the fork's turns to the source transcript.

`fork_strategy(backend, truncated)` picks between:

**`Native`** — Claude only, full forks only. The `claude_session_id` is **kept** and the
first turn runs `--resume <id> --fork-session`, which makes the Claude CLI branch its own
transcript into a fresh session id. Jean's existing write-back then records the new id,
so the two sessions can never interleave into one transcript. This costs no prompt
tokens and gives the model the real conversation.

**`Handoff`** — every other backend, and **every truncated fork**. The resume id is
cleared and `build_fork_handoff_prompt` wraps the copied Jean history in a hidden
`<jean_fork_handoff>` block, prepended to the user's message. Only
`message_for_backend` carries it; `RunEntry.user_message` keeps the original text, so
it never appears in the transcript.

A truncated fork can never go native: `--fork-session` branches from the _end_ of the
backend's transcript, which would hand the model exactly the turns the fork dropped.

Codex is handoff-only today. If its app-server gains a fork option on `thread/resume`
(check with `codex app-server generate-json-schema --out ./codex-schema`), add it to
`fork_strategy` the same way.

### Precedence on the first turn

`resolve_handoff_kind` in `chat/commands.rs` orders the injections, because a provider or
profile switch already replays the full Jean-local history:

| backend switch | profile switch | `pending_fork` | result                                      |
| -------------- | -------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| yes            | any            | any            | `ProviderSwitch`                            |
| no             | yes            | any            | `ClaudeProfile`                             |
| no             | no             | `Handoff`      | `Fork`                                      |
| no             | no             | `Native`       | `NativeFork` — no injection, resume id kept |
| no             | no             | none, move pending, not Claude | `Moved`                     |
| no             | no             | none           | `None`                                      |

Only `NativeFork` (and `None`) leave the target's resume id in place;
`HandoffKind::clears_target_resume()` encodes that.

## Moved sessions

`chat/session_move.rs` moves a session to another worktree, in the same or another
project (#67). The session keeps its id, history, run logs, attachments and settings.
The UI uses the `move_session` dispatch command (refuses a running session); the MCP
tool `move_session` uses the same function, but moves a running session after its turn.

The new worktree is another folder, so the backend context needs care:

- **Claude** resumes a conversation by id from any folder: it looks in the current
  project and its worktrees, then in every other project
  (https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sessions, "Resume by session ID or name"). The move
  keeps `claude_session_id`. The next turn only gets a hidden note: the session moved
  from `<old path>` to `<new path>`, earlier paths refer to the old folder.
  Exception: when the transcript is in more than one project folder, Claude reports
  "not found", so the send uses `LostContext` (replay) instead.
- **Every other backend** binds its resume id to the folder (OpenCode `?directory=`,
  Cursor `--workspace`, Antigravity's cwd cache) or nobody knows. `prepare_moved_metadata`
  clears those ids, and the next send is `HandoffKind::Moved`: the history replay with
  the move note.

`SessionMetadata.pending_move` (`{ from_path }`) is the one-shot marker. Like
`pending_fork`, `run_log::complete` clears it, so a cancelled first turn still gets the
handoff. A second move before any turn keeps the first path. A fork clears it.

**When you add a resume id for a new backend, clear it in `prepare_moved_metadata` too.**

Not carried over: checkpoints (their store is per worktree and the git refs are local
to the repo), so restore buttons for earlier turns go away. The frontend
(`handleSessionMoved` in `src/lib/session-move.ts`, on the `session:moved` event) fixes
the state that names the old worktree or project: the session → worktree map, the old
tab, last-opened, the pin. It also closes the session terminal in the old folder.

## Transfer to a remote Jean

A transfer (issue #35) is a fork across machines: it copies a session into a worktree
on **another** Jean instance. Code: `jean-core/src/chat/transfer.rs`,
`src/lib/session-transfer.ts`, `src/components/remote/TransferSessionDialog.tsx`.

1. This window's backend runs `export_session_bundle` (normal `invoke`).
2. The frontend posts the bundle to the chosen connection with
   `remoteInvoke(connection, 'import_session_bundle', { worktreeId, bundle })`
   (`src/lib/remote-invoke.ts` → `POST /api/invoke`). So it also works from a remote
   window to a third instance.

`SessionBundle` (format version 1, import rejects others):

- `session` and `metadata`, with `runs` reduced by `drop_in_flight_run` — a running
  turn never ships.
- `{run_id}.jsonl` run logs of the kept runs (no `.input.jsonl`).
- Attached saved contexts, named `context-…`; the target prefixes its own session id.
- Pasted images and text files that the runs reference, base64, only files directly
  in `pasted-images` / `pasted-texts`.
- `sourceDirs`: the source's pasted directories. The import replaces them with its
  own in the run logs (JSON-escaped form) and in `RunEntry.user_message` (raw form).

The import reuses the fork helpers and always uses **`PendingFork::Handoff`**: a
resume id points into the source machine's `~/.claude`, `~/.codex`, …, so even a
Claude session cannot go native. Differences from a local fork: the session keeps its
name (no "Fork of"), and `forked_from_session_id` is `None`, because the source id does
not exist on the target. The import validates the worktree (exists, not archived) and
every file name in the bundle before it writes anything.

Not transferred (v1): git-context references, checkpoints and the code. The user
pushes the branch and pulls it on the remote; the dialog says so.

### `POST /api/invoke`

A generic route (`invoke_handler` in `jean-core/src/http_server/server.rs`) that runs
one `dispatch_command` over plain HTTP, for callers that have a connection's URL and
token but no WebSocket to it:

- Body `{ command, args }`; auth like every other route (`?token=` or bearer).
- `200 { ok: true, data }`, `401 { ok: false, error }` for a bad token,
  `422 { ok: false, error }` when the command fails.
- Body limit 256 MiB on this route only; axum's default 2 MB is too small for run logs
  and images.
- An older Jean without the route answers **405** (its fallback only takes `GET`), not 404. `remoteInvoke` maps 404 and 405 to "Update … on <name>".
- Native app only. In Web Access the page origin differs from the target, so CORS
  blocks the request unless the target lists it in `JEAN_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`.

## Adding a command

`fork_session_in_place` is registered only in
`jean-core/src/http_server/dispatch.rs`. There is no second registration: the Tauri
`generate_handler![]` list holds a single `dispatch_core_command` that forwards every
command to `dispatch_command`.

# Mobile layout (smartphone / Web Access on a phone)

Jean's phone layout is reached almost always through **Web Access**: the user
opens Jean in mobile Safari or Chrome and talks to the desktop app over the
WebSocket transport. `isNativeApp()` is therefore `false` on a phone, and
"mobile" is a pure width test — `useIsMobile()` (`src/hooks/use-mobile.ts`,
`MOBILE_BREAKPOINT = 768`). There is no user-agent or platform check anywhere.

## Navigation: four tabs, projects as modals, sessions push

Below the breakpoint `MainWindowContent` renders `MobileTabShell`
(`src/components/mobile/`) instead of the desktop Home / canvas ladder. There
is no project drawer: a floating pill of four tabs is the navigation, with a
separate round search button beside it that opens the command palette.

| Tab     | Shows                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Data                                                                                 |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Home    | "Continue" first, then a Sessions / Projects switch: Unread and Recent, or every project grouped by folder with Add project / Archived. The switch lives in `ui-store.mobileHomeSegment` (not persisted) | `recentlyOpenedSessions()[0]`, `unreadSessions`, `flattenAllSessions`, `useProjects` |
| Starred | starred sessions in star order                                                                                                                                                                           | `resolveStarredSessions` over `useAllSessions`                                       |
| History | sessions you opened, most recently opened first                                                                                                                                                          | `recentlyOpenedSessions` — sorted by `last_opened_at`, not activity                  |
| Usage   | plan usage of every signed-in backend, nothing else                                                                                                                                                      | `UsagePane`                                                                          |

The active tab is persisted as `mobile_active_tab` in the UI state.

**A phone has no title bar.** `MainWindow` renders `TitleBar` on a phone only
in zen mode, where it holds the only exit (zen hides the tab bar and the session
header); otherwise the content is offset by `--safe-area-top` alone. The bar
only repeated the app name — at the tab root and in a project — and toggling it
per screen would make the content jump as a project opens. The one thing it did
say, the project name inside a session, is in the session header now. What the
desktop title bar carries has a home on the phone:

| Desktop title bar                | Phone                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| Settings button                  | A gear top right on Home, which pushes the Settings page (`MobileSettingsPage`): updates, every phone-usable Preferences pane, About. A pane opens the full-screen Preferences dialog above the page |
| Usage badge                      | The Usage tab. Its icon is the chart glyph inside a usage ring: `usePeakUsage` (the fullest window of any signed-in backend) as an arc, coloured by `usageSeverity` (`UsageTabIcon`)                 |
| App / server / CLI update badges | Updates section of the Settings page, and a dot on the Home gear                                                                                                                                     |

| File browser toggle              | The session header: opens the side panel drawer on its Files tab; Network and Graph are the other tabs (#98)                                                                                       |
| Sidebar toggle, back / forward   | Nothing: the tab bar and the project / session stack are the navigation                                                                                                                              |

The unread bell was also the only thing that refetched `['all-sessions']` when a
session is opened. That listener is now `useRefreshSessionsOnOpen`, mounted by
both the bell and `MobileTabShell` — without it History and Unread go stale.

The Preferences navigation model lives in `preferences-navigation.ts` rather
than inside `PreferencesDialog.tsx`, so the Settings page can list the panes
without pulling the lazily-loaded dialog into the main bundle.

Usage is fetched on demand in dev builds (only while the Usage tab is shown),
as the desktop badge does, so a restart loop does not hit the rate limits.

**The stack is derived, not owned.** Depth is at most three, and each level is
state the app already has: the tab root is `selectedProjectId === null`, the
project level is `selectedProjectId`, the session level is
`sessionChatModalOpen`. `MobileProjectLayer` only decides how a level is
_presented_. This is deliberate — about twenty call sites arbitrate on
`sessionChatModalOpen`, and `navigateToSession` (palette, unread bell, Home,
restore) already funnels through these fields. A second navigation store
would fight all of them. So open projects and sessions with the existing
`navigateToProject` / `navigateToSession`; never add a mobile-only path.

The project layer is entered one of two ways, decided once when it opens:

- **modal** — a project was opened. `openProjectFromTab` also calls
  `requestProjectHome`, so the canvas shows the project rather than jumping
  into its last session. The canvas rises from the bottom; a session opened
  from it pushes on top, and back from the session returns to the project.
- **push** — a _session_ was opened straight from a tab. `navigateToSession`
  selects the project and queues the session in the same tick, so a queued
  open (`hasQueuedSessionOpen`) at the moment the layer opens means push. The
  user never looked at the project, so the layer is click-through, the canvas
  content is `invisible`, and the tab shows behind the session. Closing the
  session goes back to the tab.

Inside a project, `MobileProjectSegments` switches the canvas between
**Worktrees** (the worktree list, then the open issues) and **Recent** (the
project's recent sessions and activity), like the desktop sidebar's Projects /
Recent tabs. A phone has no sidebar tree, so each worktree row gets a chevron
(`CanvasWorktreeSessions.tsx`) that lists its sessions under the row; a tap on
a session opens it, a tap on the row still opens the worktree. The expansion is
local canvas state, not the sidebar's `expandedWorktreeIds`. The choice lives in `ui-store.mobileProjectSegment` (not
persisted). On the phone the overview never stacks above the worktrees.

Push mode listens for the session closing with a layout effect, keyed to the
project id. Opening a session in another project remounts the canvas, and the
old canvas clears `sessionChatModalOpen` on unmount before the new one opens it;
without the key that blip would pop the user back to the tab.

A project restored at launch does not rise: the shell only enables the
animation a frame after `uiStateInitialized`, and the layer captures the
decision when a level opens rather than reading it live.

A session is still `SessionChatModal` — on a phone it slides in from the right,
has a back chevron in place of the desktop close X, and keeps its left-edge
swipe back. The full-screen `ChatWindow` (launch restore of an active worktree,
forks, new worktrees) is unchanged and still renders over everything.

The rest of the phone shell: `MobileFileBrowser` is a left `Sheet`, the chat
toolbar swaps its desktop controls for `MobileToolbarMenu` /
`MobileSettingsMenu` / `MobileBackendModelPickerSheet`, and the corner
`FloatingDock` hides at the tab root, where that corner belongs to search.

The tab bar sits low, concentric with the display's rounded corners: bottom
padding `max(0.5rem, --safe-area-bottom − 0.75rem)` (22pt on an iPhone, inside
its 34pt home-indicator inset, as iOS's own floating tab bar does) and 20pt at
the sides.

`useCliVersionCheck` does not run on a phone. The host's desktop window runs
it; a phone on Web Access used to run it too, showing CLI update toasts and —
with auto-update on — starting a second background update on the host. The
effect bails out explicitly, not only through disabled queries, because those
share a cache with the Preferences dialog.

The Settings page is local state in `MobileTabShell`, not a store field: it is
a page pushed over Home, not a navigation level the rest of the app opens. It
renders inside the shell rather than as a portal sheet, because a sheet shares
the Preferences dialog's layer and could cover it; the dialog is a portal, so it
always lands above the page.

## Conventions

Use these rather than inventing new ones. Each already has precedent in the
tree, and `src/components/touch-affordances.test.ts` plus
`src/components/mobile-dialog-responsive.test.ts` guard them.

### Pair `md:` with `isMobile`, never `sm:`

`useIsMobile()` is 768px but Tailwind `sm:` is 640px. Mixing them on one element
produces a half-mobile layout between 640 and 767px — the chat composer used to
show the desktop floating card _and_ the mobile safe-area padding, i.e. a
detached card with a gap under it. Anything that visually pairs with the JS
`isMobile` must use `md:`. Pure typography polish may keep `sm:`.

### Dialogs

Large dialogs go full-screen on a phone and keep their desktop size from `sm:`
up:

```
!w-screen !h-dvh !max-w-screen !max-h-none !rounded-none p-4
sm:!w-[90vw] sm:!max-w-7xl sm:!h-[85dvh] sm:!rounded-lg sm:p-6
```

If the dialog also bleeds its ScrollArea or footer past the padding
(`-mx-6 px-6`), match the mobile padding too (`-mx-4 px-4 sm:-mx-6 sm:px-6`).

Small dialogs need no phone treatment, but **never leave a `max-w-*` or
`min-w-*` unprefixed**: `DialogContent`'s base `max-w-[calc(100%-2rem)]` is what
keeps the 16px phone gutter, and an unprefixed override kills it. A
`min-w-[90vw]` beats it outright and forces horizontal overflow.

Use `dvh`, never `vh`. On iOS Safari `vh` exceeds the visible viewport, so a
centred dialog is clipped top and bottom.

### Overlay stacking

Dialog, Sheet, AlertDialog, Popover, DropdownMenu, Select and Tooltip all sit on
**one tier, `z-[80]`**. Radix portals append in open order, so the layer opened
last is on top — a dialog opened from a sheet lands above it with no override.
Do not add per-call `z-[90]`-style fixes; only app-level blockers
(`RemoteConnectionRecovery`, `RemoteConnectionsDialog`) sit higher.

- **Non-modal sheet:** pass `modal={false}` to the `<Sheet>` root, not to
  `SheetContent`. The root flag drives both Radix (no focus trap, no body
  pointer lock, page stays tappable) and the backdrop. The floating terminal and
  browser drawers use it.
- **Menu that opens a sheet or dialog:** make the `DropdownMenu`
  `modal={false}`. A modal menu locks `body` pointer-events; a sheet that opens
  while the menu animates out restores that lock on close and freezes the UI
  (`MobileSettingsMenu`, `MobileToolbarMenu`, `DockBurgerButton`).

Guarded by `src/components/ui/overlay-layering.test.tsx`.

### Hover affordances

A row action revealed only by `group-hover` is invisible and unreachable on a
phone. Use the CSS-only variant — no hook, no re-render, and correct on touch
laptops too:

```
[@media(pointer:fine)]:opacity-0 [@media(pointer:fine)]:group-hover:opacity-100
```

Watch for a sibling state class: `cn('opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100', isActive && 'opacity-50')`
cannot simply gain the variants, because both survive `twMerge` and the variant
wins the cascade — the active item would then vanish on desktop. Branch with a
ternary instead (see `TerminalView.tsx`).

### Touch targets

Aim for 44px on anything a phone user must reach. Do **not** change the `Button`
size variants — they are load-bearing for the whole desktop chrome.

- Where the control has room around it, grow the hit area and leave the visual
  box alone: `after:absolute after:-inset-2 md:after:hidden`
  (`ui/sidebar.tsx`, `ui/dialog.tsx`, `ui/sheet.tsx`).
- Where neighbours are closer than 16px, that trick makes one button steal the
  next one's edge taps. Grow the visual box instead, mobile-only —
  `size-11 md:size-6` in the title bar, `isMobile ? 'h-11' : 'h-8'` in
  `SendCancelButton`.

Tooltips are suppressed centrally on coarse pointers
(`[@media(pointer:coarse)]:hidden` in `ui/tooltip.tsx`) because Radix opens them
on focus, so a tap used to leave one stuck over the UI. Every tooltip trigger
therefore needs its own `aria-label`.

### Safe areas and the title bar

`--safe-area-top/right/bottom/left` are declared in `App.css`. The title bar is
an absolute overlay, so its height and `MainWindow`'s content offset must agree:
both read `--titlebar-height`, which folds in the top inset and is 2.75rem below
the breakpoint (for the 44px buttons) and 2rem above it. Never write a literal
height on either side.

The bottom inset belongs on whichever element is actually bottom-anchored, and
only while the soft keyboard is closed — see below.

### The soft keyboard

iOS Safari ignores `interactive-widget=resizes-content` and does not shrink
`dvh` for the keyboard. It pans the visual viewport instead, which pushes the
session header off the top. On iOS 26 the pan can also stay after the keyboard
closes (`visualViewport.offsetTop > 0`, [Apple forums
800125](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/800125)), which leaves a gap
under the composer and the header under the status bar.

So the **shell** follows the visual viewport, once: `useVisualViewportShell` in
`MainWindow` (web access only) sets `--app-height` to `visualViewport.height`,
scrolls any pan back to 0, and sets `data-keyboard-open` on `<html>`. The shell
is `h-[var(--app-height,100dvh)]`, and `html, body, #root` use the same
variable, so the document never outgrows the visible area. Every surface in the
shell (chat, terminal) sits above the keyboard with no padding of its own.

- Do not pad a surface by a measured inset inside the shell. An earlier version
  did (`useVisualViewportBottomInset` on the chat column and the terminal); it
  ran together with Safari's pan, lifted the composer twice, and a stale value
  after the keyboard closed left a band under it.
- Read "is the keyboard open" from `useSoftKeyboardOpen()`, never from an
  element's inset (that reads 0 inside the shell). Drop
  `var(--safe-area-bottom)` while it is true — otherwise a 34px band sits on top
  of the keyboard.
- `useVisualViewportBottomInset` stays only for `h-dvh` dialog portals outside
  the shell (`StandaloneTerminalSurface` in the CLI login and setup dialogs).
- If a surface scrolls, re-stick to the tail when the keyboard opens, reading
  "am I at the bottom" through a ref so the effect does not re-run on every flip.

### Mobile web is not the native app

`body.native-app` carries the desktop-only `user-select: none` and
`cursor: default`. Touch screens get their own block in `App.css`
(`@media (pointer: coarse)`): no tap highlight, `touch-action: manipulation` on
every element (no double-tap zoom delay), and no text selection or iOS callout
on app chrome. Inputs and `.select-text` opt back in, so chat text stays
selectable.

Home Screen launch on iOS 26 opens standalone even without a manifest;
`index.html` still sets `apple-mobile-web-app-capable`,
`apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style: black-translucent` (content draws under
the status bar and `--safe-area-top` pads it) and links
`public/manifest.webmanifest`. Changes to these need the Home Screen icon
removed and added again. Overscroll control is _not_ in there: `html, body {
overscroll-behavior: none }` applies everywhere, because Chrome Android
pull-to-refresh competes with Jean's swipe-down-opens-the-command-palette
gesture, and the shell never scrolls the body anyway.

### Reloads, the device view and the service worker (#72)

iOS ends a Home Screen app in the background; the next open is a full
reload. Three parts make that cheap, all in Web Access only:

- `src/lib/web-reload-log.ts` counts starts by cause (Settings → Web Access →
  This device). Reloads that the app starts go through `reloadApp(reason)`,
  never a bare `window.location.reload()`, or they count as iOS reloads.
- `src/lib/web-device-view.ts` + `useWebDeviceViewPersistence` keep this
  browser's view in `localStorage`; `getCurrentUIState()` writes the host's
  view fields back (`rememberHostView`).
- `scripts/web-service-worker.mjs` generates `dist/sw.js` (Vite plugin);
  `src/lib/service-worker.ts` registers it on HTTPS/localhost builds only.
  The server sends `sw.js` and the manifest with `no-store`
  (`static_cache_control` in `server.rs`).

Keyboard-only affordances are native-desktop only: hide `<Kbd>` hints and
disable the matching handlers in web access and on mobile (gate on
`isNativeApp()` plus `useIsMobile()`).

## Testing

`e2e/tests/mobile-navigation.spec.ts` is the one spec at a phone viewport
(390x844, touch); `e2e/tests/preferences.spec.ts` widens to 1280x720 to
_escape_ the mobile layout. The rest is covered by unit tests:

- `src/components/mobile/*.test.ts(x)` — the tab shell, tab bar, each tab,
  the project layer's modal and push entries, and its wiring into the session
  modal and canvas
- `src/components/touch-affordances.test.ts` — hover variants, tooltips, hit
  areas, `md:`/`isMobile` parity
- `src/components/mobile-dialog-responsive.test.ts` — dialog sizing, `dvh`,
  gutters
- `src/components/titlebar/TitleBar.safe-area.test.ts` — bar height,
  safe areas, overscroll
- `src/hooks/useVisualViewportShell.test.ts`,
  `src/components/chat/ChatWindow.keyboard-inset.test.ts` and
  `src/hooks/useVisualViewportBottomInset.test.ts` — soft keyboard
- `MainWindowContent.mobile-swipe.test.tsx`, `src/hooks/useSwipeBack.test.tsx` —
  phone routing and gestures

Web Access in WebKit against a real server (`bun run test:e2e:local`):

- `e2e/local/tests/phone-view-restore.spec.ts` — the phone reopens its own
  session after the page ends in the background, and the host's view stays
- `e2e/local/tests/service-worker.spec.ts` — app shell cache, update through
  the "Reload" toast, start with the server down

Known gaps against the desktop layout are tracked in
[`mobile-gap-analysis.md`](mobile-gap-analysis.md).

//! Splitkick brand values.
//!
//! Splitkick is built on Jean (coollabsio/jean, Apache 2.0). Every value that
//! keeps a Splitkick install apart from a Jean install on the same machine
//! lives here, so an upstream merge only has to touch this file and the few
//! use sites. Internal identifiers that users never see (crate names,
//! `JEAN_MCP_*` env vars, localStorage keys) stay as upstream has them.

/**
 * Connection windows — one native window per remote Jean instance.
 *
 * The main window always drives the local backend. Each remote connection gets
 * its own window, so switching costs a window focus instead of a full reload
 * of the single window. Web Access runs in one browsing context and has no
 * windows to open, so it keeps swapping the active connection in place.
 *
 * The Rust side (`src-tauri/src/connection_window.rs`) owns the window; it
 * focuses an existing one rather than opening a second for the same
 * connection, so there is nothing to track here.

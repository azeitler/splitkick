# Changelog

All notable changes to Splitkick (formerly JeanZ, built on Jean) are recorded in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.2.0] - 2026-10-29

Built on Jean 0.1.73.

### Added

- **A local end-to-end run with two instances.** `bun run test:e2e:local`
  starts two sealed Splitkick servers on this Mac (own home folder, data,
  ports) and checks session transfer, remote connections, session links,
  follow-ups, MCP sends and parent/child sessions in the real UI. (#65)
- **You can move a session to another project or worktree.** Use "Move to…" in
  the session menu (sidebar, tabs, canvas) or "Move Session to…" in ⌘K. The
  session keeps its history. Claude continues its conversation; other backends
  get the history replayed on the next message. A running session or one with
  queued messages cannot move. (#67)

### Changed

- **Session transfer works in Web Access.** The target must allow the page's
  address (`JEAN_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`); the error says so. (#65)
- **The follow-up list opens beside the chat when there is room.** Its button
  moved to the far right of the bar under the input (also in zen mode). In a
  wide window the list opens in the free space to the right of the chat; when
  the window, sidebar, file browser or browser pane leaves too little room, it
  opens above the input, as before. Phones keep the bottom sheet. (#66)

## [1.1.0] - 2026-10-29

Built on Jean 0.1.73.

### Added

- **You can set how many sessions the sidebar Recent tab shows.** Settings →
  General → Worktrees → Recent sessions (5–200, default 30).

- **You can open a worktree or project in your git client.** Tower, Fork,
  GitHub Desktop and Sourcetree are supported (macOS). Set it in Settings →
  General → Git Client; it shows in Open In (key C), the Open button and the
  worktree and project menus. Tower opens through its `gittower` CLI when it
  is installed. (#43)

- **Sublime Text is an editor choice.** Files open at the line, like in the
  other editors. (#43)

- **Settings show only the editors, terminals and git clients you have
  installed** (macOS). The app you chose stays in the list. (#43)
- **See and cancel scheduled prompts in the chat.** A banner above the
  messages shows each pending scheduled prompt of the session, when it runs
  (for example "in 2h", with date and time), and an X to cancel it. All
  schedules are now kept in one list, `schedules.json`, and a session can
  have more than one. Claude's own wakeup keeps its rule: one per session,
  the newest replaces the older. Wakeups saved by an earlier version move to
  the new list at the next start. (#38)
- **Repeating schedules.** A schedule can repeat: every hour, daily at a
  time, on weekdays, weekly, or by a cron pattern. The time is read in the
  schedule's own time zone, so "daily at 09:00" stays at 09:00 when the
  clocks change. The banner shows the rule, the next time and the last run.
  A new setting, Settings → General → Scheduled prompts → Missed runs,
  decides what happens to a schedule that came due while Splitkick or the
  computer was off: run it once at the next start (the default), or skip it.
  A repeating schedule never runs once per missed time. (#38)
- **Full Disk Access as an opt-in setting on macOS.** Settings → General has
  a "Full Disk Access (macOS)" section with the status for this session, an
  Open System Settings button and Relaunch now (macOS applies the grant only
  after a relaunch). It stops the repeated "would like to access data from
  other apps" prompts, because every tool an agent runs inherits the grant.
  Before the buttons it explains the risk: Splitkick and every program an
  agent starts could then read all of your files, including Mail, Messages
  and Safari history, and a prompt injection could read private data. Not
  granting it is the recommended default; Splitkick works fine without it.
  Onboarding does not ask for it. (#31)
- **Transfer a session to another machine.** Right-click a session, or use
  the command palette, and choose **Transfer to Remote Splitkick…**: pick a
  saved connection, a project and a worktree there, and the session is copied
  with its conversation, pasted files and saved contexts. The agent on the
  other machine gets the earlier conversation with your first message. The
  session here does not change. Push and pull the branch yourself; issue and
  PR context and checkpoints do not go along. Both instances need this
  version. (#35)
- **Chat links to sessions, worktrees and projects.** A link such as
  `[Fix redirects](splitkick://session/<id>)` in a chat shows the target's
  name and opens it on click: a session in the session modal, a worktree or a
  project on its canvas. A link to an archived or unknown target is marked
  "archived" or "not found". Agents get the link from `list_all_sessions`,
  `search_sessions` and `get_current_context`, and **Copy Link** in the
  session, worktree and project menus copies one. (#44)
- **Follow-up list: notes for later turns, next to the send button.** While
  the agent works, write down what to ask next. The list button sits in front
  of Send and shows how many notes are open; the list opens above the composer
  (a bottom sheet on phones). Tick notes off, edit, delete or drag them into a
  new order. "Use" puts a note into the message box; "Queue" moves it into the
  message queue while a turn runs. Notes are never sent on their own. Add them
  with Cmd/Ctrl+J, with "Add to follow-ups" in the right-click menu of a
  message (the selected text or the whole message), or let the agent add them
  through the `add_follow_up` MCP tool. Each session keeps its own list; it
  stays after a restart and shows in web access. (#46)
- **Sessions show which session started them.** When an agent starts a session
  through the Splitkick MCP, its chat shows "Started session ‘…’ View →" where
  it did so, and a later message into another session shows "Sent to session
  ‘…’". The started session shows "Started by ‘…’" at the top, and a fork shows
  "Forked from ‘…’". The names follow renames, and an archived or deleted
  session is marked as such. (#62)

### Changed

- **A starred session now also shows at the top of its project.** The
  project's top section, in the sidebar and on the project canvas, lists the
  project's pinned and starred sessions, most recent first. Its label follows
  the mix: "Pinned", "Starred" or "Pinned & Starred". A pin or star glyph
  shows on a row when not every row has it. You no longer have to pin a
  starred session to keep it at the top. (#41)

### Fixed

- **Claude remembers the question it asked.** When a Claude turn ended with a
  question or a plan, Splitkick stopped the CLI before Claude wrote that turn
  to its own transcript. After the answer, the model saw "No response
  requested." in place of its question, so a draft shown in an option preview
  was lost. Splitkick now waits until the turn is on disk before it stops the
  CLI. (#57)
- **Sessions no longer stay on "loading" in the iPhone Home Screen app.**
  When the phone came back from the background, the app's connection check
  could go into a dead connection and wait forever, so the app never
  reconnected and nothing loaded until it was closed. The check now gives up
  after 12 seconds and tries again. A request that timed out before it was sent
  is also no longer sent later. (#64)

- **The iPhone Home Screen app reaches the bottom of the screen.** On iOS 26
  a Home Screen app got a viewport shorter than the screen by the status bar,
  and the app kept its height to that short value, so a band stayed under it.
  The page is now as tall as the screen in that mode, and the app only follows
  the measured height while the keyboard is open. (#63)

- **A selected row keeps its spacing in the sticky sidebar.** When a selected
  project, worktree or session row stuck at the top, its highlight touched the
  row below it and the line under the stack. The stuck rows now keep the same
  small gap they have while they scroll. (#59)

- **The usage check runs every 5 minutes again, not every second.** When
  Claude's usage could not be refreshed (an expired login, rate limiting), the
  app kept asking again at once, every second, and with every window switch.
  It now waits the full 5 minutes. The same applies to Codex and Grok usage.
  (#58)

- **Auto-archive on a merged PR no longer stops a running session.** A worktree
  stayed linked to its first, merged PR after the agent switched to a new
  branch, and every PR status check archived it again and cancelled the run.
  Now the archive waits while a session runs or waits for input, and while the
  worktree has uncommitted changes. When the worktree has moved past the merged
  PR, the link follows the current branch instead of archiving. A merged PR
  archives a worktree only once, also after an unarchive and a restart. (#50)
- **The Projects tree follows navigation from the Recent tab.** A session you
  open from Recent is now expanded and scrolled into view in the Projects tree,
  so it shows as soon as you switch to Projects; Recent stays the active tab.
  A project or session picked in ⌘K while Recent shows now switches the
  sidebar to Projects and reveals it there. A project revealed above the view
  now lands below the stuck section headers, not under them. (#60)
- **A session started by chat keeps the mode it runs in.** A message sent
  through the Splitkick MCP tool with an execution mode (for example yolo) ran
  in that mode, but the toolbar still showed plan, and the next answer or
  approval from the app ran in plan. The mode now becomes the session's mode,
  and open windows switch the toolbar to it. The model given with such a
  message still applies to that one turn only. (#61)
- **A scheduled wakeup runs with no window open.** When Claude's
  `ScheduleWakeup` came due, the backend only told the window to send the
  prompt; with no window open, or on a headless host with no client, the
  prompt was lost. The backend now puts the prompt in the session's queue and
  sends it. It uses the session's saved model and mode, not Sonnet and yolo
  as before when the window had not loaded the session (#38).

## [1.0.15] - 2026-10-27

Built on Jean 0.1.73.

### Changed

- **The sidebar keeps its headers in view while you scroll.** Starred,
  Folders and Projects now scroll in one list. A section header you scroll
  past stays at the top, stacked above the next one. Below the headers, the
  folder, project and worktree rows stay too, so you always see where the
  sessions on screen belong; the next row pushes the old one out. Click a
  stuck header to jump to the start of its section. A thin line marks the
  bottom of the stack. On a short window the headers get smaller. (#45)

## [1.0.14] - 2026-10-26

Built on Jean 0.1.73.

### Added

- **You can see which sessions hit the Claude session limit.** When Claude
  stops a run with “You've hit your session limit”, the session now shows an
  amber lightning icon in the sidebar. Its tooltip gives the reset time. In
  the chat, a banner shows the same message with two buttons: **Resume**
  sends “continue”, and **Resume with message** puts the cursor in the
  message box. The icon and the banner go away when the next run starts.
  This also works for a run that stopped while Splitkick was closed.

### Fixed

- **A fork's GitHub lists show the fork, not the original.** In a project
  with an `upstream` remote, the issues, pull requests, CI runs and PR status
  came from the upstream repository, and a worktree for issue #N loaded the
  upstream issue #N. Splitkick now asks GitHub for the repository of the
  `origin` remote. A default repository chosen with `gh repo set-default` is
  still used as before. (#56)

### Changed

- **The connection rows react to the mouse.** In the server connections
  dialog a row now lights up on hover, darkens while you click it, and shows
  a focus ring for the keyboard. The connection this window drives has a
  light background. Before, the rows gave no feedback at all. (#53)
- **Notifications name the session.** A banner now reads, for example,
  “Session “Fix the relaunch helper” finished”, with the project and worktree
  below, instead of a generic “Session finished”. Long names are shortened.
  The same goes for failed sessions and sessions that need your input. (#54)
- **A new sidebar layout.** The Projects | Recent switch is now at the top.
  The Projects tab shows Home and Starred (both stay in place), then Folders
  and Projects, then Archived. Folders and Projects work like Starred: click
  the header to fold the section, and the app remembers it. Each header has
  its own "+ New" button. The section icons line up with Home, and the rows
  of each section sit one step in, like starred sessions. The Folders header
  has its own icon, so it does not look like a folder. Folder rows now look
  like project rows: the same font, icon size, spacing and hover. An open
  folder draws the same thin guide line under its icon that a project draws
  for its workspaces. A folder inside a folder is now indented one step, not
  two. Archived opens the archived items in the main area,
  like Home. The "+ New" and "Archived" buttons at the bottom are gone. (#55)

## [1.0.13] - 2026-10-23

Built on Jean 0.1.73.

### Fixed

- **Splitkick starts again after "Restart" for an update.** The restart quit
  the app but sometimes did not open it again. The helper that reopens
  Splitkick now waits until macOS has fully let go of the old app, checks that
  the new one runs, and tries again if not. Each restart is written to
  `relaunch.log` in the log folder (Help → Show Log), so a failed one can be
  traced.

## [1.0.12] - 2026-10-23

Built on Jean 0.1.73.

### Fixed

- **Remote connections stay up.** A window connected to another Splitkick
  server dropped its connection again and again and showed "Couldn't
  connect". When the server was busy, it could drop a client that had
  answered its ping; it now reads the client's answer first. After a real
  drop, the window now reloads by itself as soon as the server answers
  again, and the error screen shows only when the server stays away for
  about 20 seconds. ([#52](https://github.com/azeitler/splitkick/issues/52))

## [1.0.11] - 2026-10-22

Built on Jean 0.1.73.

### Fixed

- **Restarting after an update works again.** Since 1.0.9 the restart failed
  with "Update failed: Unknown command: relaunch_app", so the update only took
  effect after you quit and reopened Splitkick by hand. Restart from a remote
  window restarts this Mac's app, too.

## [1.0.10] - 2026-10-22

Built on Jean 0.1.73.

### Fixed

- **Fast loading with many projects.** Each project row in the sidebar loads
  four GitHub badges, and with many projects Splitkick started hundreds of
  `gh` processes at once. They blocked the backend, so the Recent tab said
  "No sessions yet" and other views stayed on "Loading…" for a long time. Now
  at most four of these GitHub calls run at the same time, and the other
  commands do not wait for them. When the session list cannot load, the
  Recent tab says so and offers Retry. A view no longer waits forever for a
  lost answer, and a stalled background `git fetch` stops after 30 seconds.
  ([#51](https://github.com/azeitler/splitkick/issues/51))

## [1.0.9] - 2026-10-21

Built on Jean 0.1.73.

### Fixed

- **One Dock tile after a restart.** Since 15 October (Tauri 2.12) a restart
  after an update opened a second copy of Splitkick next to the one in the
  Dock, so the Dock showed Splitkick twice and the pinned tile stayed with
  the old copy. The restart now waits for the old copy to end and opens
  Splitkick once, like a click in the Dock. The same applies to the restart
  after an import from Jean.

## [1.0.8] - 2026-10-21

Built on Jean 0.1.73.

### Fixed

- **A clear error when macOS blocks the worktree folder.** Claude then failed
  with a wrong hint about "low max file descriptors". Splitkick now checks
  the folder before it sends and says what to do: restart Splitkick (needed
  after an update) or allow it in Privacy & Security. The prompt goes back
  into the input.
- **Updates no longer cut off iCloud folders.** Splitkick installed an
  update as soon as it was downloaded, while the old version kept running.
  macOS then denied the running app its folders in iCloud Drive until you
  restarted it. An update is now downloaded first and installed when you
  click Restart. If you quit instead, Splitkick offers it again on the next
  start.

## [1.0.7] - 2026-10-21

Built on Jean 0.1.73.

### Fixed

- **A prompt sent just after a reply is queued, not bounced.** For a few
  seconds after a reply, Splitkick still saves the turn's file changes (longer
  in iCloud folders). A prompt sent then went back into the input with no
  message. It now goes into the queue and runs as soon as Splitkick is free.

## [1.0.6] - 2026-10-18

Built on Jean 0.1.73.

### Fixed

- **A failed send shows its error and keeps it.** When the Claude CLI
  stopped at once (for example when macOS blocks the worktree folder), the
  error flashed and vanished, and the prompt went back to the input with no
  reason. The error now stays above the input until you dismiss it or send
  again, also after a restart.
- **A newer default Claude model sticks.** Settings only knew Claude models
  up to Opus 5, and on every start a model it did not list went back to
  Opus 4.8. Fable 5.1, Opus 5.5, Sonnet 5.5 and Haiku 5.5 are in the model
  lists now, and a saved Claude model id is kept even when it is newer than
  the list.
- **The phone no longer opens the file browser on its own.** The phone and
  the desktop host share one saved layout, so a file panel open on the host
  opened the file drawer on every phone load, and closing the drawer on the
  phone closed the host's panel too. The drawer now opens only when you open
  it on the phone, and the host's panel stays as you left it.

## [1.0.5] - 2026-10-18

Built on Jean 0.1.73.

### Added

- **Help → Show Log.** Opens Splitkick's log file in Console, so an error can
  be read and sent with a report without searching for the file.

### Fixed

- **No more Reload menu on a right-click.** Where Splitkick has no menu of
  its own, a right-click showed WebKit's default menu with Reload and Inspect
  Element, and Reload threw away the window's state. That menu is gone; text
  fields, the editor and selected text keep Cut, Copy and Paste. The browser
  pane keeps its browser menu.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-10-18

Built on Jean 0.1.73.

### Fixed

- **Selecting text in the file viewer's editor works on macOS 15.** The
  editor asked WebKit for the selection in a form that only newer WebKit
  builds know, so every selection threw "Type error" and broke the editor.
  Splitkick now translates the call for the older WebKit. (#42)

## [1.0.3] - 2026-10-16

Built on Jean 0.1.73.

### Added

- **Phone: a worktree lists its sessions.** A chevron on each worktree row in
  a project opens its sessions under the row; tap one to open it.
- **Phone: pin and star a session.** The gear menu in the composer has Pin
  to Project and Star for the open session. Before, both needed a long-press
  that the scrolling tab strip usually swallowed.

### Fixed

- **A session no longer stays in Waiting because of an old blocked tool.**
  When a hook blocked a tool call, the denial stayed on the session for good:
  in yolo mode there is no panel to approve or dismiss it, and it outranked
  Review, Paused and Idle from the status menu. A new message now clears the
  previous turn's denials. (#49)
- **Uncaught errors reach the app log.** They went to the console only,
  which a release build cannot open, so a crash such as the file viewer's
  edit-mode error left no trace to report. (#42)
- **Files open in view mode.** The file viewer opened every file in the
  editor, which threw an error as soon as you selected text. Click Edit to
  change a file. (#42)
- **Images in the file viewer zoom and pan.** They use the same viewer as
  images in a chat: pinch, scroll or double-click to zoom. This also works
  in a remote window. (#42)
- **Phone: the chat keeps its header when the keyboard opens.** Safari's
  page pan no longer pushes the session header off screen, and there is no
  empty band under the composer, with the keyboard open or after it closes.
- **Session rows on Home, Starred and History show status and labels.** The
  status dot had no size, so it never showed. Labels were missing in web
  access, because only the native app loaded them into the store.
- **Phone: projects sit under their folders, in sidebar order.** Home →
  Projects listed every loose project first and the folders below them,
  ignoring the order you set. Folders now come first, each with a clear
  heading, then the projects without a folder.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-10-16

Built on Jean 0.1.73.

### Changed

- **Filled buttons are white in the dark theme, not orange.** Orange read as
  an error on Send, Cancel, Update and count badges. Orange stays for focus,
  selection and running states; the title bar update badges turn neutral too.
- **Usage meters go green, amber, red.** Green below 50%, amber from 50%, red
  from 75% — in the title bar ring, the Usage settings and the mobile tab.
- **The sidebar pull badge (↓N) is white.** It was orange, the same as errors.

### Fixed

- **Sessions sit one step in from their status group in the sidebar.** The
  group labels (Waiting, Review, Idle, …) were indented as far as their
  sessions, so a group read as one more session row. (#39)
- **Paused, Review and Idle apply to a session stuck in Waiting again.** A
  leftover waiting flag with no question or plan behind it counted as an open
  question, and an open question outranks those statuses, so picking them did
  nothing. A real pending question or plan still keeps its priority. (#40)
- **The file viewer shows and logs its own errors.** When the editor fails to
  draw a file, the viewer shows the error with a Reload button and keeps your
  unsaved changes, instead of replacing the code with a raw error box. The
  error is also written to the app log, so a report can include it. (#42)

## [1.0.1] - 2026-10-16

Built on Jean 0.1.73.

### Added

- **A remote window shows the remote agent's HTML pages.** Click an HTML file
  in a chat, or let the agent open one, and it loads in the browser pane with
  its styles, scripts and images. The remote instance serves the files of its
  projects and worktrees for this. Cmd-click opens the page in your browser.
  Only static files; a dev server on the remote machine is still not
  reachable. (#37)

### Changed

- **Splitkick orange instead of Jean's yellow.** The dark theme's accent
  (Send, focus rings, selection) and the "running" indicators in both themes
  use Splitkick orange. Yellow stays for things that wait for you.
- **Rounded buttons in the chat input.** Send, Cancel and the controls next to
  them (model, effort, mode, attachments) have rounded corners.

### Fixed

- **The DMG download is notarized, not only the app inside it.** macOS
  rejected the downloaded 1.0.0 DMG as not notarized, although the app in it
  was.
- **A remote window shows which instance it drives again.** Since the Mac-style
  toolbar, the remote name sat only in the window title, and every view that
  fills the toolbar title hid it, so a remote window looked like the local one.
  The toolbar now shows a badge with the remote's name next to the title,
  whatever is on screen and also in zen mode. Hover it for the host.

- **A remote window's close, minimise and zoom buttons sit where the local
  window's do.** A remote window drew them at the macOS default, higher and
  further left than in the local window. It is now built from the same window
  settings as the local one, so both match. The same applies to the local
  window when Splitkick reopens it after you closed it.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-10-16

Built on Jean 0.1.73.

### Added

- **Splitkick 1.0.0, the first public release.** JeanZ is now Splitkick: a
  separate app with its own name, icon, bundle identifier and data folder, so
  it installs and runs next to Jean. Signed and notarized for Apple Silicon,
  with in-app updates from this repository.
- **Import from JeanZ or Jean.** On first start Splitkick imports a copy of
  your projects, sessions, chat history, settings, window layout, remote hosts
  and browser logins. JeanZ's copy wins where both exist; the source is only
  read.

### Changed

- **Own worktree folder, MCP server and port.** New worktrees go to
  `~/splitkick/<project>/`, the MCP server is named `splitkick`, and Web Access
  defaults to port 3460. A `jean.json` in a repository is still read when there
  is no `splitkick.json`.

## [1.0.0-rc.3] - 2026-10-16

Built on Jean 0.1.73.

### Fixed

- **Every version display shows the Splitkick version.** The connection
  windows, the sidebar and Web Access said 0.1.73, the version of the Jean
  base, instead of the Splitkick version.

## [1.0.0-rc.2] - 2026-10-15

Built on Jean 0.1.73.

### Fixed

- **The Splitkick download is notarized by Apple**, so macOS opens it without
  a Gatekeeper warning. 1.0.0-rc.1 was signed but not notarized.

## [1.0.0-rc.1] - 2026-10-15

Built on Jean 0.1.73.

### Added

- **Import from JeanZ or Jean.** On first start Splitkick finds existing
  JeanZ or Jean data and offers to import a copy: projects, sessions, chat
  history, saved contexts, settings, window layout, remote hosts and browser
  logins. Where both exist, JeanZ's copy wins. The source is only read. Worktrees stay where they are. Jean's old defaults that clash are
  replaced in the copy (Web Access port 3456 → 3460, 7-day archive deletion →
  never, delete on close → archive).

### Changed

- **JeanZ is now Splitkick.** New name, icon, bundle identifier
  (`app.splitkick.desktop`) and data folder
  (`~/Library/Application Support/app.splitkick.desktop`), so Splitkick installs
  and runs next to Jean. New worktrees go to `~/splitkick/<project>/`, the MCP
  server is named `splitkick`, Web Access defaults to port 3460, and the
  project config file is `splitkick.json` (an existing `jean.json` is still
  read). Updates come from the Splitkick repository, signed with a new key.

## [0.1.73-z.26] - 2026-10-15

Built on Jean 0.1.73.

### Added

- **Mac-style window toolbar.** The sidebar now runs to the top of the
  window, and a toolbar above the content shows what you are looking at: the
  project or session name, its badges and its actions, plus a search field.
  Settings, connections, usage, updates and the unread bell moved to the
  bottom of the sidebar; GitHub, Sponsor and the version are in its ⋯ menu.
- **macOS grays in the dark theme.** The content area is now #1e1e1e and the
  sidebar a lighter #2b2b2d, as in macOS apps, instead of one near-black for
  everything. Yellow stays the accent. The light theme gets the same split: a
  light gray sidebar (#f5f5f7) next to white content.
- **Mac-style sidebar rows.** The selected project, worktree and session get a
  rounded highlight, and every level indents by the same width. With only one
  worktree in a project, the project and the session are highlighted, not the
  worktree.
- **Mac-style session tabs.** Session tabs are rounded, with the title on the
  left. Hover a tab and its status dot turns into the close button. Hold ⌘ to
  see the ⌘1–⌘9 shortcuts.
- **A full macOS menu bar.** New File, Go, Session and Help menus put most
  shortcuts in the menu bar, and Help has the macOS menu search. The menu shows
  your own keybindings: change a shortcut in Settings and the menu changes too.
- **Dock badge and dock menu.** The dock icon shows the number of unread
  sessions, the same number as the bell in the title bar. Right-click the dock
  icon to open one of the last sessions or to start a new worktree.
- **Notifications open their session.** Click a "Needs your input", "Session
  finished" or "Session failed" notification to go to that session. When a
  session needs your input while Jean is in the background, the dock icon
  bounces once.

### Changed

- **JeanZ continues as Splitkick.** This is the last JeanZ build. JeanZ shows
  a one-time notice and stops looking for updates; Splitkick is a separate app
  with its own data folder that imports JeanZ's projects and sessions on first
  start.
- **New installs keep chat history for ever.** On a new install, archived
  items are no longer deleted after 7 days (the default is now "Never"), and
  closing a session or worktree archives it instead of deleting it. An
  existing install keeps its own settings; to keep archives for ever, choose
  "Never" under "Auto-delete archives" in Settings → General.
- **A plan sent to a new session or worktree archives the original session**,
  never deletes it, whatever the removal setting says.

- **Zen mode moves to Ctrl+Cmd+Z on macOS.** Cmd+Shift+Z is Redo again. If you
  set your own zen shortcut, it stays.
- **Cmd+M opens only the Magic Menu.** Window → Minimize no longer shows the
  same shortcut.

### Fixed

- **Changed default shortcuts now reach every client.** Keybindings saved on
  this device kept old defaults after an update; they are now updated like the
  server copy.
- **No more lost remote windows.** The Window menu lists every open window. A
  window that comes back hidden, 0x0 or off every screen now opens visible at
  its normal size, centred.
- **The chat input keeps a margin.** In a narrow window the chat input no
  longer touches the left and right edges.
- **The Recent tab in the sidebar is easier to see.** The Projects / Recent
  switch now has a visible track.
- **A failed update check tells you why.** "Check for Updates…" now shows the
  error in its toast, and every failed check, manual or automatic, is written
  to the app log.
- **Overlays on the phone stack in the right order.** A dialog opened from a
  sheet now shows above it: the layer you opened last is always on top.
- **The floating terminal and browser drawers no longer block the page.** The
  chat beside them stays tappable and scrollable.
- **The phone UI no longer freezes after a menu opens a sheet.** Picking
  Effort, Thinking, MCP or Scripts from the settings menu, or an action from the
  toolbar or dock menu, could leave every tap ignored.
- **Jean on the iPhone Home Screen feels like an app.** The status bar blends
  in, a tap shows no grey flash, there is no double-tap zoom delay, and a long
  press on a button no longer selects text or shows the iOS callout. Chat text
  stays selectable. Remove the Home Screen icon and add it again to pick up the
  new app settings.

- **A worktree whose folder went missing no longer loses its history.** It is
  archived instead of dropped, and it comes back by itself when the folder
  returns (for example a drive that was not mounted at start). Automatic
  archive cleanup never deletes such a worktree or its branch. Before, the
  next start deleted all of its sessions.
- **The startup cleanup moves orphaned session data to a trash folder**
  (`trash/<date>/` in the data folder) instead of deleting it, skips sessions
  written in the last 10 minutes, and skips the cleanup when a session index
  cannot be read.
- **Archiving a session never deletes it by mistake.** A session whose history
  failed to load, and every terminal session, is archived, not deleted.
- **Claude keeps the context of old sessions.** Claude Code deletes its
  transcripts after 30 days; a session whose transcript is gone now gets its
  earlier conversation replayed from Jean's own copy, instead of silently
  starting over.

## [0.1.73-z.25] - 2026-10-14

Built on Jean 0.1.73.

### Added

- **Projects / Recent tabs in the sidebar.** Below Home, switch the sidebar
  between the project tree and your latest sessions from all projects. Each
  Recent row shows the project and worktree, grouped by Today, Yesterday and
  Earlier. On the phone, a project has the same switch: Worktrees or Recent.

## [0.1.73-z.24] - 2026-10-14

Built on Jean 0.1.73.

### Added

- **Zoom in the image viewer.** Pinch, double-tap, or scroll to zoom into an
  image, and drag to pan when zoomed. On a phone the viewer fills the screen,
  centers the image, and keeps the close button clear of the notch.

### Fixed

- **Projects drag only from their row.** Dragging inside an open project (its
  worktrees, sessions, or empty space) no longer moves the whole project. The
  same applies to folders.
- **The app stays fast with many sessions.** Switching sessions or finishing a
  run now refreshes only the affected worktree, not every session list of
  every project. The cross-project session list no longer reads archived
  worktrees. Sidebar rows re-render only when one of their own sessions
  changes, not on every tool event of any session.
- **Session lists load faster.** Jean keeps each session's list entry in memory
  and parses its metadata file again only when the file changes. Before, every
  refresh parsed the full run history of every session.
- **Git status checks no longer rewrite the projects file.** A status sweep
  saves a worktree only when its counts changed, not once per worktree on every
  sweep.

## [0.1.73-z.23] - 2026-10-12

Built on Jean 0.1.73.

### Fixed

- **Claude never loses the conversation after a cancel.** The z.22 fix was not
  enough: a new conversation only got its id once Claude answered, so a turn
  cancelled before any output left the session with no id, and the next turn
  started from zero. Jean now picks the Claude session id itself and saves it
  before Claude starts. Every Claude turn either resumes that id or starts a
  conversation under it.

## [0.1.73-z.22] - 2026-10-09

Built on Jean 0.1.73.

### Fixed

- **Claude keeps the conversation after you cancel a turn.** When you
  cancelled a turn before Claude wrote anything, Jean read the empty answer as
  a dead conversation and dropped its resume id. The next turn then started
  from zero ("I don't have any context"). A cancel no longer drops it.

## [0.1.73-z.21] - 2026-10-09

Built on Jean 0.1.73.

### Fixed

- **The workspace dot in the sidebar tree no longer sticks on "Waiting".**
  The z.20 fix corrected the session rows, but the workspace row worked out
  its own dot from the raw waiting flags. It ignored a manual status such as
  "In review" and flags left over from finished runs, so the dot kept
  blinking. The dot now uses the same status as the session rows.

## [0.1.73-z.20] - 2026-10-07

Built on Jean 0.1.73.

### Added

- **The chat tells you where a plan went.** When you send a plan to a new
  session or a new worktree and "Close original session on clear context" is
  off, the original chat shows a notice under the plan. It links to the new
  session and offers to mark the original complete, archive it, or continue
  there.

### Fixed

- **Sessions no longer stick in "Waiting", and a manual status change sticks.**
  When you sent a new message after a plan or question, the session list kept
  the previous turn's waiting flag, so the session showed "Waiting" for the
  whole turn. A plain "Waiting" with nothing to answer also blocked a manual
  status such as "In review". The new turn now clears the flag everywhere, a
  manual status now wins over a plain "Waiting", and an answered OpenCode
  permission request no longer leaves the flag set on disk.
- **Remote hosts with many projects stay responsive.** When a client
  connected to a host with many projects, the host started hundreds of git
  status threads at once. Each result rewrote the project list under one lock,
  and the server stopped answering, including its heartbeats. Requests timed
  out and the connection dropped. The host now runs every remote command off
  the threads that answer the connection, checks git status with 8 workers in
  total, and skips the rewrite when the values did not change.
- **A slow or failed check no longer looks like a fresh install.** When a CLI
  check timed out, Jean showed the backend as "not installed" and opened
  onboarding, showed "Setup incomplete", or could pick a different default
  backend. A failed check now counts as unknown and keeps its last result.
  When the project list cannot load, Jean shows "Couldn't load projects" with
  a Retry button instead of the welcome screen or "No projects found".
- **Plans approved from the plan dialog now close the original session.** The
  plan dialog ignored "Close original session on clear context" when it sent a
  plan to a new session or worktree; the original stayed open.
- **A new worktree no longer disappears seconds after it was created.**
  Background writers, such as the status refresh that a new worktree starts,
  could save an older copy of the project list over the new entry. The git
  worktree stayed on disk, but Jean lost track of it. Writers that run next to
  worktree creation now read, change and save the list in one locked step
  (#34).
- **A plan sent to a new worktree starts from the session's branch.** It used
  the project's default branch. When the local branch has commits that are not
  pushed yet, the new worktree now starts from the local branch, not from
  `origin` (#34).
- **A missing base branch is an error.** Jean silently used `main`, `master` or
  the current branch when the requested base branch or the project's default
  branch did not exist. It now says which branch is missing (#34).
- **Sending a plan to a new worktree no longer hangs silently.** When git was
  fast, Jean could miss the "worktree created" signal and wait two minutes
  before it showed an error. A name conflict now shows an error at once (#34).

## [0.1.73-z.19] - 2026-10-05

Built on Jean 0.1.73.

### Changed

- **Recent activity is closed until you click it.** The feed on Home and on a
  project's home showed little more than "Session finished" rows. It is now a
  single line under _Recent sessions_; click it to open the feed. Home uses the
  freed column for the sessions and the projects.

### Fixed

- **Claude no longer logs out with "OAuth session expired and could not be
  refreshed".** To show usage, Jean refreshed the Claude login token itself.
  Each refresh made the token that running `claude` sessions held invalid, so
  their next refresh failed. Jean now only reads the token and leaves the
  refresh to Claude. When the token has expired, the usage display shows the
  last known values until Claude refreshes it.
  ([#30](https://github.com/azeitler/jean/issues/30))
- **A fork opens on the new session.** After _Fork session_ or _Fork from this
  message_, Jean sometimes selected an unrelated session — the first tab — in
  place of the fork. The fork is now selected, and stays selected.
- **An answer to a Claude question is no longer lost.** Sometimes the answer
  went to a turn that had already ended: no new run started, and the session
  stayed on "running". The answer now starts a new run each time.
- **The plan approval menu lists the same models as the model picker.**
  _Other model…_ under Yolo and Build fell back to a built-in list, so every
  backend showed stale models — the Claude, Codex, PI, Command Code, Grok, Kimi
  and Antigravity entries were the ones compiled in, not the ones you can pick
  in the chat toolbar. It now uses the toolbar's list.
  ([#33](https://github.com/azeitler/jean/issues/33))

## [0.1.73-z.18] - 2026-09-28

Built on Jean 0.1.73.

### Added

- **Images in an answer stay a sensible size, and open full size on click.**
  An embedded image used to render at full size, so a tall screenshot filled
  the whole thread. It now shows at most half the window high, and never more
  than 640 px. Click it to see the full image; for a local file the preview
  has a _Reveal in Finder_ button. Right-click an image in an answer, or an
  image you attached, to reveal it too — only where Jean can reach that
  machine's file manager.

## [0.1.73-z.17] - 2026-09-27

Built on Jean 0.1.73.

### Added

- **Reveal a file from a chat answer in Finder.** Right-click a file path in an
  answer and choose _Reveal in Finder_ — _Explorer_ on Windows, _Files_ on
  Linux — to show the file in its folder. It reveals the file the reference
  resolved to, so `~/Downloads/report.png` and a path inside a monorepo package
  both land on the right one. The item appears only for a local file, and only
  where Jean can reach that machine's file manager.

### Fixed

- **You can fork a session while its turn is still running.** The in-place fork
  refused with "Cannot fork a session while it is running". Now both fork
  shapes start from the last finished answer and leave the running turn in the
  original session. The worktree fork no longer copies the half-written turn as
  a crashed one, and a Claude fork taken mid-turn no longer branches from it.

- **Restarting Jean opens the session you left, not just the project.** The
  app came back on the project page with nothing open, although "Restore last
  session" was on. The project page loads its worktrees and their sessions in
  one go, so it could be ready before Jean had read your settings — and an
  unread setting counts as off, after which the decision was already made and
  never taken again. Jean now waits for the settings before it decides. Two
  further gaps went with it: a session you switched to in the last half second
  before quitting was never written down, and so was lost on the next start;
  and a session or workspace you had closed, archived or deleted stayed on
  record as the last one open, which restored nothing at all.

## [0.1.73-z.16] - 2026-09-23

Built on Jean 0.1.73.

### Added

- **A session with an unsent message now shows a pencil in front of its name.**
  A half-written prompt already survived a tab switch and a restart, but
  nothing said so: the tab and the sidebar row looked the same as an empty
  session, and you only found the draft by opening it again. The pencil appears
  on the session tab, on the sidebar row, and on a starred or pinned row, and it
  counts a pasted image or a pasted text file as a draft too — not only typed
  text. It goes as soon as the message is sent.

### Changed

- **Picking a project in CMD+K opens the session you last had open there.**
  Switching projects used to land on the project page with nothing open, and
  you then had to find the session you had left. Now the session you last
  opened in that project opens at once, just like a session result in the
  palette. When there is none, or it was archived or deleted since, you get
  the project page as before. Fixes
  [#22](https://github.com/azeitler/jean/issues/22).

- **On a phone, Home puts where you left off first, then switches between
  sessions and projects.** Continue — the session you had open last — now
  comes first, above a Sessions | Projects switch. Sessions lists what finished
  since you last looked, then every other session by latest activity, with a
  filter. Projects lists your projects, grouped by folder. The switch keeps your
  choice while you move between tabs.

- **A phone has no title bar any more.** It only repeated the app's name, so
  the screen gets that space back. In a session, the header now names the
  project, the one thing the bar used to add. Zen mode keeps the bar, because
  it holds the only way out of zen.

- **The phone tab bar sits lower, following the rounded screen corners** —
  inside the home-indicator area, as iOS's own floating tab bar does.

### Fixed

- **A remote Jean no longer shows a permanent "Update available".** The badge
  meant the _host_ you are connected to needed updating, but it used the same
  wording and the same place as this app's own update, so it read as a phantom
  offer while the local app was current. It now says **Host update**, names the
  host version in the tooltip, and follows the install: _Updating host…_, then
  **Restart host** once the download is done — the host cannot ask anyone to
  restart it, because nobody is sitting there. Requesting an update no longer
  reports success before anything is installed, a host busy with sessions says
  so and keeps the offer, and the badge disappears by itself once the host runs
  the new version.

- **Letting go of the right button no longer runs a context-menu item.** Near
  the bottom of the window the menu moves up to fit on screen, which put an
  item right under the pointer. Releasing the button then ran that item and
  closed the menu, so you could archive or delete a session you only wanted to
  right-click. A menu now ignores the release that opened it, and waits for you
  to choose. Clicking an item, and holding the button down and letting go on an
  item, both still select it.

- **A long context menu now scrolls.** A menu taller than the space left below
  it was cut off, so the last items — Archive and Delete Session — could not be
  reached.

- **A file path with spaces or tildes in a chat answer is no longer broken.**
  An iCloud path such as `…/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/…` lost its
  tildes: Markdown read `~apple~` as struck-through text, so the folder name
  became `comappleCloudDocs` and the file could never be found. Only the
  `~~like this~~` form strikes through now. A path with spaces was also cut at
  its first space, and the fragment after the last space became the link. A
  path that stands alone on its line is now taken whole, spaces and all.

- **A file reference keeps the form you wrote.** The file viewer, the browser
  pane and its address bar showed the full path Jean had resolved, so
  `~/Downloads/report.png` came back as
  `/Users/you/Downloads/report.png`. The resolved path is used to find and
  open the file, and what you wrote is what you see.

- **A Markdown file in the browser pane is no longer covered by another tab.**
  With more than one tab open, the page of a tab you were not looking at could
  sit on top of a Markdown or text file, so the document was hidden behind a
  web page. Every tab loads its page when the pane opens, and a tab that was
  not active put its page over the pane instead of out of sight. It now goes
  out of sight at once, and stays there until you switch to it.

- **A phone no longer shows CLI update alerts, or starts CLI updates.** Over Web
  Access the phone ran the same CLI version check as the desktop: it showed
  update toasts, and with automatic updates on it started a second update on
  the host alongside the desktop's own. The phone now leaves this to the
  desktop.

## [0.1.73-z.15] - 2026-09-21

Built on Jean 0.1.73.

### Fixed

- **A `../` file path in a chat answer now finds the file.** A reference such
  as `../shared/api.md` written from `packages/web` means
  `packages/shared/api.md`, and nothing found it. Both readings are offered
  now — the sibling folder and the one above the worktree — and a `..` in the
  middle of a path is resolved before the search.

## [0.1.73-z.14] - 2026-09-21

Built on Jean 0.1.73.

### Changed

- **JeanZ is built on Jean 0.1.73 again.** The merge of upstream Jean 1.0.1
  in 1.0.1-z.12 is reverted. It caused errors that were hard to find: in the
  desktop app with remote servers, some sessions showed only your own
  messages, answers appeared above their questions, and the pinned sessions
  in the sidebar switched on and off while an agent ran. All JeanZ changes
  stay, including the account email on the usage screen from 1.0.1-z.13.
  - These upstream 1.0 features are gone again: the combined view of all
    servers in the main window, the Recent tab and the new sidebar layout,
    and the Steer action. A remote opens in its own window again, as before.
  - **Install this build by hand, one time.** A copy on 1.0.1-z.12 or
    1.0.1-z.13 does not offer it as an update, because 0.1.73 counts as an
    older version. Open the DMG from the release page and drag JeanZ to
    Applications. After that, updates arrive in the app again.
- **Clear context asks before it deletes.** Clearing a session removes its
  history and the backend's resume id, and it cannot be undone. JeanZ now
  shows a confirmation first.

### Fixed

- **A question from the agent keeps its options.** Jean stopped the Claude
  CLI when the last piece of a question or plan arrived. That could happen
  before the CLI wrote the finished tool call to its output. The question
  showed while it was live, but after a session switch or a restart only its
  first sentence was left. Jean now stops the CLI only after the finished
  tool call is saved. A question whose options are missing now says so and
  points you to the message box. Fixes
  [#32](https://github.com/azeitler/jean/issues/32).

## [1.0.1-z.13] - 2026-09-21

Built on Jean 1.0.1.

### Added

- **The usage screen and popover show which account you use.** Each backend
  line starts with the signed-in email, for example `you@example.com · max`.
  Claude reads it from `~/.claude.json` and Codex from its login token. Grok
  shows it when its user endpoint sends one. The MCP `get_usage` tool also
  returns it as `accountEmail`.

## [1.0.1-z.12] - 2026-09-21

Built on Jean 1.0.1.

### Added

- **JeanZ is now built on Jean 1.0.1.** The upstream releases 1.0.0 and 1.0.1
  are merged in. The largest upstream additions:
  - The main window can show the projects of all your remote servers
    together, with a server filter in the sidebar and a toggle for each
    server in the connections dialog. A window that you opened for one remote
    still shows only that remote.
  - A Recent tab in the sidebar lists the worktrees you worked in last.
  - Jean MCP and the Agent Browser are now always available to the agents.
    Jean repairs their setup at start.
  - A separate Steer action sends a message into a running turn. A normal
    send waits in the queue.
  - New MCP tools let an agent change a session's model and settings.
  - Many fixes for Windows, Codex, Docker, and the CLI paths.

### Changed

- **The sidebar has the upstream layout.** It has two tabs, Projects and
  Recent, one search field for projects and worktrees, and a footer with
  Settings and the version. The Home row, Starred, the per-project session
  filter and the sort menu stay.
  - A project row no longer has its own Settings and New worktree buttons.
    Use the project's context menu or the project page.
  - The version moved from the title bar to the sidebar footer.
  - New folder is a button next to Add project. Archived opens from the
    command palette and the dock menu.
- **All icons come from one icon set.** Upstream replaced its icons, so some
  icons look a little different.

- **On a phone, Jean is navigated with tabs instead of a drawer.** A floating
  bar at the bottom has four tabs — Home, Starred, History and Usage — and a
  round search button beside it that opens the command palette. The drawer that
  held the whole desktop project tree, four levels deep, is gone, and so is the
  swipe that opened it.
  - **Home** lists what needs you (sessions that finished since you last
    looked), the session you had open last, and every project, grouped by
    folder. The gear top right opens Settings.
  - **Starred** lists your starred sessions. On a phone they were easy to miss
    in the drawer; now they have a tab.
  - **History** lists the sessions you opened, most recently opened first —
    ordered by when you looked, not by when an agent last wrote.
  - **Usage** shows your plan usage. Its icon is a ring that fills to your
    highest limit and turns amber, then red, as you approach it.

  A project opens as a sheet that slides up over the tabs, and a session slides
  in from the right. The back arrow, or a swipe from the left edge, takes you
  back one step. A session opened from Starred, History, search or the unread
  count goes straight back to where you opened it, not to a project you never
  looked at. The tab you were on comes back after a reload.

- **On a phone, the title bar shows only the title.** Its buttons all moved to
  where you use them: Settings behind the gear on Home, the usage badge onto the
  Usage tab, the unread count onto the Home tab, updates and the About links
  onto the Settings page, and the file browser into the session header. In zen
  mode the title bar keeps its exit button, because zen hides every other way
  out. Nothing changes on the desktop.

### Fixed

- **Web Access no longer offers an update JeanZ cannot install.** When upstream
  Jean published 1.0.0, a phone connected to JeanZ showed "Update Available —
  Version 1.0.0 is ready on the host Jean app". Tapping Update did nothing: the
  host checked upstream's release feed, while JeanZ installs only its own
  builds, signed with a different key. The check now reads the JeanZ feed, the
  same one the app's own updater uses.

  Two things had to change with it, or real JeanZ updates would never have
  reached the phone. The check now compares against the version the build was
  released as — `0.1.73-z.11`, not the plain `0.1.73` it used to report — and
  it orders JeanZ builds by their `-z` number, so `z.12` counts as newer than
  `z.11`. The alert stops once a JeanZ build with this fix is installed on the
  host.

## [0.1.73-z.11] - 2026-09-21

Built on Jean 0.1.73.

### Added

- **Markdown and text files open as a readable page in the browser pane.** A
  `.md` file opens as a formatted page — headings, tables, task lists and code
  blocks with a copy button — and a `.txt` or a `.log` as monospace text. Before,
  the pane showed a Markdown file as its own source, and an em dash in a UTF-8
  text file came out as `â€"`. Reload reads the file from disk again, which is how
  you see an edit an agent has just made. Back, Forward and Grab do nothing for a
  file Jean draws itself, and are greyed out.

### Fixed

- **A file named in chat opens the file that was meant.** Clicking a path in an
  answer, or an `@`-mention, joined it onto the worktree root and hoped. In a
  monorepo, or for a file an agent wrote inside a package, that names a file
  which is not there, and the viewer opened on "File not found". Which file a
  link pointed at could even change with the worktree selected when you clicked.

  Jean now works out where the file is before it draws the link. The paths this
  session's own tool calls touched come first — a Read or an Edit records
  exactly where the agent was — then the worktree and any linked project, and
  failing all of those Jean searches the worktree for a path that ends with the
  reference. A reference that matches several files (twelve packages, one
  `README.md` each) asks which one you mean instead of choosing for you. A
  reference that matches nothing is no longer a link: it keeps its place in
  the text with a question-mark icon, and pointing at it explains what Jean
  checked. A file the agent writes during the turn becomes a link by itself
  when the turn ends. A path that starts with `~/` opens in your home folder —
  on a remote connection, the home folder of the machine Jean runs on. A path
  that starts with `../` opens the folder above the worktree, or, when the
  agent was working in a subfolder, the file it really touched there.

- **The chat composer stays above the keyboard on a phone.** Tapping the input
  used to push the composer and its toolbar under the on-screen keyboard, so you
  typed into a box you could not see. iOS Safari does not shrink the page for the
  keyboard the way other browsers do, and Jean's layout fills the screen exactly,
  so there was nothing left to scroll. Jean now measures the visible area and
  lifts the composer above the keyboard, the same way the terminal's extra-keys
  bar already did, and keeps the last message in view. Opening the terminal
  drawer still works as before — only the surface at the bottom compensates, so
  nothing is padded twice.

- **The title bar clears the status bar and the notch.** Added to an iPhone home
  screen, or held in landscape, the bar was drawn underneath the status bar and
  the buttons at the edges were hard to hit. The bar now reserves the room the
  phone asks for, on all four sides. Nothing changes on a desktop.

- **Buttons on a phone are big enough to hit.** The title bar was the only way to
  reach the sidebar, the file browser and Settings, and its buttons were 24
  pixels — smaller than a fingertip. They are 44 pixels on a phone now, and the
  bar grew to match. The Send button and the dialog close buttons did too. To
  make room, the GitHub, Sponsor and version links are hidden on a phone; they
  are all still in Settings and on Home.

- **Actions you could only reach by hovering are visible on a phone.** A phone
  has no hover, so these buttons simply did not exist there: editing, removing or
  sending a queued prompt, restoring or deleting an archived item, and the row
  actions on labels, commits, saved contexts and Linear issues. They are always
  visible on a touch screen now, and unchanged on a desktop.

- **Tapping an icon no longer leaves a tooltip stuck on the screen.** A tooltip
  opens on focus as well as on hover, so a tap opened one with nothing to close
  it. Tooltips are off on touch screens.

- **Dialogs fit a phone screen.** The plan dialog was wider than the screen, and
  the Approve buttons could be cut off the bottom — awkward, since approving a
  plan from a phone is one of the main reasons to open Jean there. It is
  full-screen on a phone now. The GitHub dashboard was squeezed into a box
  narrower than the screen instead of filling it. The release notes, teardown
  output and update dialogs ran edge to edge with their corners off-screen. Four
  more dialogs were measured against the wrong idea of the screen height on iOS
  Safari and were clipped at the top and bottom.

- **The projects sidebar is no longer hidden behind the file browser.** With both
  open on a phone, the file browser was drawn on top and dimmed the sidebar, so
  the main navigation sat behind the panel it should sit in front of. Closes
  [#28](https://github.com/azeitler/jean/issues/28).

- **Small phone fixes.** Toasts were 271 pixels wide on a 375-pixel screen and
  now use the full width less a margin. Pulling down at the top of the page no
  longer triggers the browser's own refresh, which used to fight Jean's
  swipe-down gesture for the command palette. Between 640 and 767 pixels wide the
  composer mixed the desktop and phone layouts and showed a floating card with a
  gap under it.

- **Web Access stops reloading the page when you leave the tab.** On a phone this
  happened constantly: switch to another app, take a call, lock the screen, and
  coming back to Jean threw away your composer draft, your place in the
  conversation and any dialog you had open.

  A mobile browser suspends a background tab and closes its WebSocket. Jean
  treated any dropped connection as a reason to reload the page, because a fresh
  page was the simplest way to rebuild its in-memory state. That trade made sense
  on a desktop, where the socket almost never drops, and was painful everywhere
  else.

  Jean now reconnects instead. When the socket comes back it re-runs the same
  bootstrap request the page start uses, replays the events it missed while it
  was away, and refetches its data — everything a reload did, without discarding
  what you were typing. Long-running work was never at risk: sessions and
  terminals live in the backend and keep going regardless.

  If the desktop app was updated while you were away, Jean still asks you to
  reload, because the page's code is genuinely out of date. Native remote clients
  keep the recovery screen they had.

- **Renaming a session from its right-click menu stays open.** Choosing
  Rename sometimes flashed the name field and closed it again, or saved the
  name before you had typed anything. The menu handed focus back to the row as
  it closed, and a short timer only usually beat it. The field now opens only
  after the menu has fully closed, so nothing takes focus from it.

  Two related slips are fixed with it. Right-clicking another session while a
  rename is open no longer saves the half-typed name; it drops the edit. And a
  right-click inside the name field now shows the normal Cut / Copy / Paste
  menu instead of the session menu. This applies to the sidebar rows, the
  Starred and Pinned rows, and the session tabs. Fixes
  [#29](https://github.com/azeitler/jean/issues/29).

- **The Claude usage indicator reads the login you are actually using.** On some
  Macs the indicator never showed a number. It alternated between "Claude usage
  API is rate-limiting requests" and "Claude session expired", while Claude
  itself kept working.

  The login keychain can hold more than one item named `Claude Code-credentials`,
  and Jean asked for one without naming an account, so macOS returned whichever
  came first. Worse, Jean had created the duplicate itself: after refreshing a
  token it wrote the result under the account `claude`, while Claude Code stores
  its own item under your macOS user name. From then on Jean read a copy that
  nobody refreshed, and once it expired Jean was stuck with it.

  Jean now looks at every candidate item and takes the one that expires last, so
  an old copy can no longer win. A refreshed token is written back to the item it
  came from, never to a new one — which also removes the risk of rotating Claude
  Code's refresh token away and logging the CLI out. When a token is already
  expired and the refresh is declined, Jean says so instead of sending the dead
  token and reporting the answer as rate-limiting.

  If a Mac already has the stray item, this removes it from the picture
  ([#30](https://github.com/azeitler/jean/issues/30)). You can also delete it
  directly; Claude Code's own item is not affected:

  ```sh
  security delete-generic-password -s "Claude Code-credentials" -a claude
  ```

- **Claude asks you questions and presents plans again.** Since Claude Code
  2.1.187 a Claude session could not show the question picker or a plan to
  approve: it fell back to a plain-text numbered list, and plan mode ended
  without a plan. Claude Code now offers `AskUserQuestion`, `EnterPlanMode`
  and `ExitPlanMode` only to a host that names a tool to answer permission
  requests, and Jean named none. Jean now runs a small internal MCP server,
  `jean-dialog`, for every Claude turn and points Claude at it.

  The server is separate from the Jean MCP server in Settings, so switching
  that off does not take questions or plans with it. The model never sees
  `jean-dialog` in its tool list. If `jean-dialog` is the only server Jean adds
  to a turn, Jean no longer passes `--strict-mcp-config`, so MCP servers you
  set up outside Jean in `~/.claude.json` still load.

  Also fixed on the way: Jean stopped the Claude process on the first,
  still-empty chunk of a question or plan, so the picker or the plan would have
  come up blank. Jean now waits until the whole tool input has arrived. Fixes
  [#1](https://github.com/azeitler/jean/issues/1).

- **A URL in backticks is a link now.** An agent that wrote a dev-server
  address as code — `` `http://localhost:5174/#/demo` `` — left you with text
  to copy by hand, while the same address in a sentence was a link. Inline
  code that holds exactly one web address is now a link and opens in the
  embedded browser, like a file path in backticks already did. Code with
  anything else in it, and an address of another kind (`postgres://`), stay
  code.

## [0.1.73-z.10] - 2026-09-14

### Added

- **The browser pane opens more than HTML now.** Double-click in the Files
  sidebar, or click a path in a chat answer, and an image, an SVG, a PDF, a
  movie or a text file opens in the pane beside the chat. Only HTML did before;
  everything else went to the file viewer. Source files, archives and anything
  else the web view cannot draw still open there, and "Open" in the right-click
  menu always uses the file viewer.

  Markdown and plain text are a partial case worth knowing about: the web view
  shows them as text, but a `file://` text file carries no character set, so the
  web view reads it as Latin-1 and an em dash in a UTF-8 file shows as `â€"`.
  The file viewer renders Markdown properly and is one right-click away.

### Fixed

- **A file the browser pane cannot find now says so.** The pane showed a
  spinner that never stopped. The web view fails a missing file in a callback
  Jean never received, so nothing ever ended the load. Jean now checks the file
  before the pane loads it and shows a message that names it. Any other load
  that starts and never finishes ends in an error after 20 seconds, instead of
  spinning for good.

- **A movie no longer spins for ever either.** The web view hands a movie to its
  own player and then reports the page load as failed, although the player is on
  screen and playing. The pane counts a movie as loaded as soon as it starts.

- **Chat: a path whose name holds `#`, `?` or letters outside ASCII now becomes
  a link.** `bericht-übersicht.html` was left as plain text, and `q#1?draft.html`
  was cut at the `#` and treated as a fragment. Jean now reads a `#` or a `?` as
  part of the name when the name up to that point is not a file Jean can open.
  A name with a space is still not linked on its own: nothing tells
  `open out/report.html` (a command) from `04 report.html` (a name). Write that
  one as a normal Markdown link.

- **The browser address bar accepts a path.** Pasting `/Users/me/page.html`
  built `https:///Users/me/page.html` and loaded nothing, because the bar read
  anything with a dot in it as a web address.

- **Every Jean window now carries its own name.** With one window per remote
  the macOS Window menu, Mission Control and the app switcher listed them all as
  "Jean", because nothing ever set the window's own title. Each window is now
  named after the breadcrumb in its title bar — the instance, project and
  worktree it shows — and a connection window carries its remote's name from the
  moment it appears.

- **A cancelled prompt now comes back into the chat input.** If you stopped a
  turn after it started but before the first word of the answer, Jean threw the
  turn away and left the input empty, so the text was gone from both places and
  you had to type it again. The backend now reports when it discards a turn, and
  the input gets the prompt and its attachments back. A turn that already
  produced an answer still keeps that answer in the history and leaves the input
  empty. Text you typed after cancelling is never overwritten.

## [0.1.73-z.9] - 2026-09-14

Built on Jean 0.1.73. Fixes for what 0.1.73-z.8 shipped 30 minutes earlier.

### Fixed

- **A remote window whose connection you delete now closes itself.** The check
  that should have caught it could never run, so the window stayed open, fell
  back to the local backend, and drove this machine while looking like the
  remote one.

- **A cancelled first turn of a fork no longer writes into the original
  session.** A fork borrows the original's Claude conversation for its first
  turn and branches it. Cancelling that turn before any reply lost the branch
  flag while the borrowed id stayed, so the next message continued the
  original conversation and mixed the two.

- **A vibrancy change now reaches the next window.** Windows opened after the
  toggle kept the material read at startup.

## [0.1.73-z.8] - 2026-09-14

Built on Jean 0.1.73.

### Added

- **A remote instance now opens in its own window.** Connecting to a remote Jean
  replaced the local instance inside the single window, and every switch paid for
  a version probe, a full reload and a discarded cache. The main window now stays
  local, each remote gets a window of its own, and switching is a window focus.
  Opening a remote that is already on screen focuses its window. Each window
  remembers its own size and position, and the macOS menu acts on the focused
  window only. Web Access is unchanged — a browser has one page to work with.
  ([azeitler#26](https://github.com/azeitler/jean/issues/26))

- **Chat: the right-click menu of a link offers "Open in Default Browser".**
  It shows for a web link, and for a local HTML file when the file is on this
  machine. Clicking the link itself still uses the embedded browser.

- **Chat: fork a session in place, or from any message.** Jean could already fork
  a session into a new git worktree, but the action was buried in the Magic menu
  and it was the only shape on offer.
  ([#105](https://github.com/coollabsio/jean/issues/105))
  - **Fork Session (same Worktree)** makes a sibling session tab on the same
    files, for a second line of questions about the same code.
  - **Fork from here**, in the right-click menu of any message, keeps the
    conversation up to that point and drops the rest. Right-click an agent answer
    and the fork ends with it; right-click your own message and the fork stops
    just before it, so you can ask something different there.
  - Both fork actions are now in the session right-click menu, next to the
    renamed **Fork Session (new Worktree)**.

- **Jean MCP: two questions about your sessions, one call each.** An agent
  could not answer "which sessions can I archive?" or "do we have a session
  about X?" without walking `list_projects` → `list_worktrees` →
  `list_sessions` → `read_session_messages`. Ten projects with five worktrees
  is more than 60 calls before a single message is read, and the listing left
  out the manual status, labels, pins, stars and the linked issue or PR — the
  very signals the answer depends on.
  ([#24](https://github.com/azeitler/jean/issues/24))
  - **`list_all_sessions`** returns every session of every project as one flat
    page: effective status, days idle, the status you set by hand, the session
    label and the worktree labels, pinned and starred, the linked issue and the
    pull request with its cached state. Filter by project, by days idle or by
    status; sort `stale` to put the best archive candidates first; page with
    `limit` and `offset`. Absent values are left out rather than sent as
    `null`.
  - **`search_sessions`** searches message text **and** session names across
    every project, so a session found by its title alone still appears. Narrow
    it to one project, and include archived sessions when you want them.
  - **Two opt-in extras, priced honestly.** `includeRecap` returns the last
    `## Recap` block each session wrote — a summary by the agent that did the
    work, at no inference cost. `includeOpenWork` returns uncommitted file and
    unpushed commit counts per worktree. Both run only over the page that is
    returned, and neither ever reaches the network.
  - **`read_session_messages` can be cheap now.** `role: "user"` returns only
    your prompts and opens no run log at all; `excludeTools` drops tool
    payloads and reports a count instead; `maxCharsPerMessage` cuts each
    message. Messages come back in the order they were written, and `limit`
    now means messages rather than turns.
  - **Guidance for every backend, not only Claude.** The server sends MCP
    `instructions` when a client connects, and serves two prompts,
    `review_sessions_for_archiving` and `find_session`. Both say to show you
    the proposal and wait, and to archive nothing on their own. Nothing is
    written into your `~/.claude`.

- **Project page: a Home-style overview beside the worktrees.** The project
  page now answers, for one project, the questions the Home view answers for
  everything: what you did last, what you can act on, and what is waiting.
  ([#23](https://github.com/azeitler/jean/issues/23))
  - Three equal columns on a wide window: **Recent sessions** with **Recent
    activity** under it, then **Worktrees**, then **Open issues**. It is the
    same container-query grid as Home, so the two pages read the same way. The
    columns split at a wider point than Home's, because a worktree row carries
    the branch, git badges, diff stats and PR state.
  - **Recent sessions** lists every session of the project, across all its
    worktrees, newest first. It has the filter field and the label chips from
    Home. The field appears from two sessions on, where Home waits for six,
    because the list is already narrowed to one project. A project with no
    sessions keeps the heading and says so.
  - **Recent activity** shows only that project's events. Jean now filters the
    activity log in the backend, before the row limit, so a busy project can no
    longer push a quiet one out of its own feed.
  - **Open issues** lists the open GitHub issues, newest first, with their
    labels and a **new** mark for the last 24 hours. Click a row for the
    preview. Long lists stop at 20 rows and offer the full list. The section
    stays away for a project with no GitHub remote, and for one where the
    GitHub CLI is not signed in.
  - A button in the project header hides the overview, and the choice survives
    a restart. A search hides it too, and brings it back when the search is
    cleared.

- **The title bar names the remote instance.** A Jean connected to a remote
  instance showed the same `project › worktree` title as a local one, so the
  only sign of the remote was a small dot on the server icon in the title bar.
  The title now starts with the connection name, as in
  `Build server › jean › my-feature`. With no worktree selected it shows the
  connection name alone. The name also reaches the browser tab title, and it
  stays in zen mode and on a phone, where a wrong-machine mistake costs the
  most. A local Jean keeps the title it had. A browser tab on Web Access
  carries no connection name, so it keeps its title too.

### Changed

- **Escape no longer closes a session.** Escape is the reflex for dismissing a
  popover, a menu or an autocomplete, and every miss threw the open session
  back to the project page, mid-sentence. Close a session with **Cmd/Ctrl+W**
  (rebindable in Settings → Keyboard), the close button on the tab, or the
  close control in the session header. Escape still cancels a session rename,
  and still closes the dialogs, menus and terminal inside a session.

### Fixed

- **Embedded browser: links that open a new tab work again.** In a page shown
  in the browser pane, a link with "open in new tab" behaviour, and any page
  that calls `window.open`, did nothing at all. Such a link now opens as a new
  tab beside the current one. A link the pane cannot show (for example
  `mailto:`) goes to the system default application.

- **Chat: a forked session no longer starts with an empty head.** The fork showed
  the full conversation but the agent had none of it, because Jean cleared the
  backend resume id and only replayed history when the backend changed. A Claude
  fork now branches the transcript natively with `--fork-session`; every other
  backend gets the copied history injected on the first turn.
- **Chat: an Antigravity fork no longer continues the original conversation.**
  `antigravity_session_id` was the one resume id the fork did not clear, so the
  fork resumed the source instead of starting its own branch.
- **Chat: a fork no longer carries the original's stale run state.** Copied runs
  kept a checkpoint id pointing at the source worktree, a stale process id, and
  could stay marked as running — which made the fork refuse its first message.
  Attached contexts and linked issues or pull requests now follow the fork
  instead of being left behind.
- **A failed pin or star now says so.** Pinning or starring a session changed
  the screen and nothing else: the write to disk happened 500 ms later, and a
  failure only reached the log. The pin looked correct until the next start,
  when it was gone. This could happen on a disk error, and over Web Access when
  the connection dropped mid-write.
  ([#25](https://github.com/azeitler/jean/issues/25))
  - A pin, unpin, star or unstar now waits for its own write. If the write
    fails, the value goes back to what is on disk and an error toast names the
    action, with the reason under it.
  - A dropped Web Access connection reverts without a toast, because the client
    reloads from disk anyway.
  - Every other piece of UI state — sidebar width, expanded rows, drafts —
    still saves quietly in the background, as before.

- **JeanZ shows its own icon and its own name in the browser tab.** The flavor
  overlay renames the window and swaps the Dock icon, but it cannot reach the
  frontend: Vite builds `index.html` and copies `public/` before Tauri runs. A
  JeanZ app therefore served Jean's purple favicon and the title "Jean" over Web
  Access. The macOS webview has no tab strip, so this only ever showed in a
  browser or on a phone home screen.
  - The favicon, the apple-touch-icon, the browser tab title and the home-screen
    name now follow the flavor.
  - **The icons ship under a content-hashed filename, and stable Jean gets this
    too.** Every static asset except `index.html` is served with a one-year
    `immutable` cache, so new bytes at `/favicon.png` would never have reached a
    browser that already loaded it. `index.html` is served `no-store`, so the new
    name arrives on the next load. Any future icon change now reaches open tabs
    by itself.
  - The About dialog, the title bar and the "was updated" notice read the product
    name instead of spelling out "Jean".
  - The version row in Settings → General still says "Jean". It shows the version
    from `package.json`, which never carries the `-z.<n>` suffix, so naming it
    JeanZ would put the fork name beside the upstream version.

## [0.1.73-z.7] - 2026-09-11

Built on Jean 0.1.73.

### Changed

- **Home: recent sessions list every session and have a filter.** The list
  showed 8 sessions and a "Show more" button that went up to 25. It now shows
  all sessions from the start, newest first. In the three-column layout the
  column scrolls on its own.
  - A **Filter sessions...** field sits in the section header, like the one
    for projects. It matches the session name, the project, the worktree and
    the label, and ignores upper and lower case. Type a project name to see
    only the sessions of that project.
  - The field shows once there are 6 sessions, the same point as the projects
    filter. The label chips moved to their own line below the header.
  - When nothing matches, the list says so.
  - In both sections, a filter field that holds text now stays visible, so a
    filter can always be cleared.

### Fixed

- **Chat: relative image and file paths work in a session opened from the
  project page.** An image such as `![plan](docs/plan.png)` showed as broken,
  and a link to `docs/notes.md` did not open. The project page clears the
  active worktree, so Jean had no folder to put before the relative path. The
  session window now gives its own worktree folder to the images and links in
  it. ([#19](https://github.com/azeitler/jean/issues/19))

## [0.1.73-z.6] - 2026-09-10

Built on Jean 0.1.73.

### Added

- **Chat: links and HTML files in responses open in the embedded browser.**
  Click a web link or the path of an HTML file in an agent's reply, and Jean
  shows the page in the browser pane of the session.
  ([#21](https://github.com/azeitler/jean/issues/21))
  - Web links (`https://...`, `http://localhost:5173`) open in the embedded
    browser. A small ↗ button after the link, or Cmd-click (Ctrl-click on
    Windows and Linux), opens the system browser.
  - Paths of HTML files are now links: in plain text (`out/report.html`,
    `/tmp/report.html`), in backticks, and as `file://` URLs. The page loads
    with its styles, scripts and images. Cmd-click opens it in the default app.
  - Other file links still open in the file viewer.
  - Agents can open a page themselves with the new Jean MCP tool
    `open_in_browser`. It takes a URL or a file path. When the session's
    worktree is not on screen, the tab waits in its browser pane. A Jean
    connected to a remote backend skips a `localhost` URL, which points at the
    backend's machine.
  - In web access, there is no embedded browser: web links open a new tab and
    HTML files open in the file viewer, as before.
- **Global search: a matching project jumps to the top of Quick.** When you
  type the start of a project name in CMD+K, that project now shows first, in
  its own **Go to Project** group, above sessions and commands. Type a few
  letters and press Enter to switch project.
  - A project shows there when its name equals what you typed, or starts with
    it. Upper and lower case do not matter.
  - An exact match comes first. So `jean` opens the project **Jean**, even when
    a project called **jeanz** was opened more recently.
  - The other matches follow, most recently opened first. Among them, the
    project you are in comes last.
  - A match inside a name does not count: `app` does not pin **My App**. That
    project still shows in the normal Projects group.
  - A pinned project is not listed a second time further down.
  - This applies to Quick only. The Sessions, Projects and Search messages tabs
    are unchanged.
- **Chat: image embeds in responses show as images.** When an agent writes
  `![alt](path)`, Jean now shows the image in more cases.
  ([#19](https://github.com/azeitler/jean/issues/19))
  - A path with spaces (for example `~/Library/Application Support/...`) shows
    as an image, not as literal text.
  - A relative path opens from the current worktree, the same way links do.
    Encoded paths (`%20`), `file://` URLs, Windows drive paths and inline
    `data:image/...` images also work.
  - A file outside the folders Jean can serve directly (for example `/tmp`)
    is read through the file viewer's loader.
  - If the image cannot load, a small placeholder shows the alt text. Click it
    to open the file in the viewer.
  - Image syntax inside code blocks stays as text. Unsafe sources, such as
    `javascript:`, are still blocked.
  - Web access loads project and worktree images too.
- **Files sidebar: HTML files open in the embedded browser.** Double-click an
  HTML file, or select it and press Enter, to show the page in Jean's browser.
  The context menu of an HTML file now starts with **Browse now**.
  - `.html`, `.htm`, `.xhtml`, `.xht` and `.shtml` files count as HTML. Upper
    and lower case do not matter.
  - The page loads from disk, so its own stylesheets, scripts and images load
    too.
  - A single click on an HTML file now only selects it. To read the source,
    use **Open** in the context menu.
  - If a browser tab already shows the file, Jean reloads that tab instead of
    opening a second one. This shows your latest edits.
  - The browser opens where the browser shortcut opens it: in the session
    window when one is open, otherwise at the right side of the main window.
    With no workspace or session open, a message tells you to open one.
  - This works in the desktop app on this computer only. In web access, and
    when connected to a remote Jean, HTML files still open in the file viewer.

### Fixed

- **Starred: a star always shows.** A star on a session that Jean had not
  listed yet — a new session, one an agent created over Jean MCP, or one from
  another Jean app on the same data — was saved but never shown in the Starred
  section or on Home. Starring a session now refreshes the list.
- **New sessions reach every list at once.** Home, the Starred section, the
  command palette and the unread bell now learn about a new session as soon as
  it is created, also when an agent creates it over Jean MCP, and when a base
  session is reopened with its earlier sessions.
- **Session tabs work with a screen reader.** The tab bar's + button is named
  "New session", and the current session tab is marked as current.

## [0.1.73-z.5] - 2026-09-10

Built on Jean 0.1.73.

### Added

- **Back, Go to and Forward in the title bar.** Three buttons follow the
  connections and usage buttons, after a small gap. Back and Forward work like
  the buttons of a browser.
  - Back and Forward step through the places you visited: Home, a project
    page and a session. A new navigation after Back drops the forward steps.
  - Go to opens the command palette, so you can jump to a session or project.
  - `Cmd+[` goes back and `Cmd+]` goes forward. You can change both in
    Settings → Keybindings. The tooltips and the Keybindings pane show them as
    ⌘ [ and ⌘ ].
  - A place that can no longer be opened — its workspace was closed or its
    session archived — is replaced by the place Back actually took you. The
    next Back goes past it, and Forward still works.
  - The history is kept in memory. It starts again at launch, after Jean
    restores your last view. The buttons are hidden on mobile.

### Changed

- **Home lays its sections out in columns.** Projects, recent sessions and
  activity were stacked, so the activity feed sat below the fold.
  - The columns follow the width of the Home view, not of the window, because
    the sidebar takes a changing share of it. Wide: three columns, each of
    which scrolls on its own. Medium: sessions beside activity, with projects
    below. Narrow: one column.
  - Rows in the session and activity lists take two lines, so a narrow column
    does not cut a session name down to a few characters.
  - The Home row stays at the top of the sidebar when you scroll, and lines up
    with the section headers and the project folders below it.
  - The file browser is hidden on Home, where it had nothing to show. Its
    title bar button and its shortcut do nothing there. Your setting is kept,
    so the panel comes back with the next project.
- **Title bar: the Usage button shows how close you are to a plan limit.** It
  was a plain chart icon. It is now a badge with a ring and a percentage: the
  highest session or weekly figure of all signed-in backends (Claude, Codex,
  Grok). The button also moved after the connections button.
  - The tooltip names the limit, for example "Claude · Weekly 64%".
  - The ring is blue below 70%, amber from 70% and red from 90%, the same as
    the bars in the Usage pane.
  - Sub-limits, such as Claude Sonnet and Codex Reviews, do not count. The
    dock badge ignores them too.
  - With no signed-in backend, or before the figures load, the badge shows the
    chart icon.
  - A click still opens the Usage pane in a popover.
- **Sidebar: a pinned session carries a pin on its row.** It sits beside the
  star of a starred session, under the workspace and in the Starred section.
  Rows in the Pinned section carry no pin, since every row there is one.
- **Sidebar: a session's label comes last on its row,** after the activity
  timestamp.

### Fixed

- **Home: a failed activity load says so.** The feed showed "Nothing yet"
  when the load failed, and it never tried again. It now shows "Could not load
  activity" with a Retry button. A refresh that fails after the feed has
  loaded keeps the events on screen.
- **Sidebar: a project row click always shows the project page.** For some
  projects the click opened a session instead.
  - With **Restore last session on project switch** on — the default — the
    project page reopened the last session of the project the moment it
    appeared. A click on the project row is a request for the page itself, so
    it now skips that restore once. Other project switches still restore.
  - A click on the row of the project you are already in left its open
    session on top. The click now closes that session.
- **Sidebar: a workspace row click shows the session it opens.** The click
  selected a session but left a collapsed row collapsed, so the selected
  session was not visible in the tree. The row now expands. A workspace with
  no sessions stays collapsed, since there is nothing to show.
- **Sidebar: pinned sessions are indented like a workspace's sessions.** They
  sat flush under the Pinned row, with no guide line. They now have the same
  offset and guide line as the sessions under a workspace, also on a narrow
  sidebar. ([#17](https://github.com/azeitler/jean/issues/17))
- **Sidebar: a Starred or Pinned row opens its session in place.** The click
  also expanded the session's workspace and scrolled the tree to the original
  row, away from the row you clicked. The tree now stays where it is. The
  command palette, the unread bell and Home still reveal the session in the
  tree. ([#18](https://github.com/azeitler/jean/issues/18))

## [0.1.73-z.4] - 2026-09-10

Built on Jean 0.1.73. JeanZ versions carry a `-z.<n>` suffix; the counter is
this fork's own and never restarts.

### Added

- **Star sessions to keep them in reach from anywhere.** Pinning keeps a
  session under one project's row. A star is the global counterpart: starred
  sessions sit at the top of the sidebar, right under Home, whatever project is
  selected.
  - Star and Unstar sit in the session menu next to Pin to Project. A pin is
    local and a star is global; a session can carry both, and they are
    independent.
  - The sidebar's **Starred** section shows each session with its project and
    workspace, since the list crosses projects. It collapses like a workspace
    row, shows a count while collapsed, remembers that across restarts, and
    disappears while nothing is starred.
  - The Home view gets a **Starred** section above Recent sessions, with the
    same rows.
  - Both lists keep star order, newest star last, so a starred session stays
    where you left it — Recent sessions already orders by activity.
  - Starred rows carry the full session menu, like pinned rows: rename,
    status, labels, pin, archive, delete. A starred session also shows a small
    star on its row in the tree and in the Pinned block.
  - A star follows its session when the session moves to another workspace.
    An archived starred session drops out of the lists but keeps its star, so
    restoring it brings the row straight back.
  - Stars are saved with the rest of the sidebar state on this machine, like
    pins.

- **Sidebar: sort the sessions of a project.** Sessions under a workspace
  always came back in one fixed order, so a long list could only be scanned.
  A sort button now sits on the project row, next to "Filter sessions".
  - **Default** keeps today's order exactly. **Last activity** starts newest
    first; **Title** starts A → Z, ignores case and compares numbers as numbers,
    so "session 2" comes before "session 10".
  - Picking the active mode again flips its direction. The direction is also
    offered on its own, in words that fit the mode — "Newest first" / "Oldest
    first", "A → Z" / "Z → A".
  - The button stays dimmed on the default order and turns full strength with
    a mode-specific icon otherwise, so a non-default order is never invisible.
    Its tooltip names the active order.
  - The sort works inside each status group of each workspace. The groups, the
    order of the workspaces and the Pinned block are all left as they were.
  - Each project remembers its own sort across restarts.

- **A Home view collects recent sessions and an activity log.** Jean opened on
  the last thing you had selected, so picking work back up after a break meant
  walking the sidebar project by project to find what had moved.
  - **Recent sessions** lists the sessions you touched last, newest first,
    across every project, with the status dot and the labels each row carries
    in the sidebar. Click one to open it.
  - **Recent activity** is a history feed rather than a to-do list: runs that
    finished, were cancelled or crashed, commits, pull requests opened, merged
    and closed, and finished AI code reviews. A row that has a URL, such as a
    pull request, opens it; the rest jump to the session.
  - The log holds the newest 500 records and is trimmed in place, so it never
    grows without a bound.

- **An agent can mark its own session complete.** The MCP tool
  `set_session_status` takes `completed`, so an agent that has finished its work
  takes the session off Jean's attention list itself, instead of leaving it for
  you to clear by hand. Omit `sessionId` and it targets the calling session.
  Live states — running, waiting for input, plan approval, crashed — still win
  while the session is active; the manual status shows once it goes idle.

- **JeanZ inherits stable Jean's look and client settings on its first start.**
  Jean's own data — projects, sessions, worktrees, preferences, CLI logins —
  is shared by path and was never at risk. Two stores sit outside that
  directory and follow the bundle identifier instead, so a JeanZ build with its
  own identifier would have started with both of them empty.
  - The WebView store carries the theme, the zoom level, the client
    preferences, the cached model catalog and the remote-connection list. The
    whole store is copied, so cookies and IndexedDB come along too. The
    per-origin directories inside it are named from the page origin and a salt
    that travels with the tree, so the copy lands where the new WebView looks.
  - The Tauri plugin state beside the data directory is copied as well: the
    window geometry and the persisted file scope.
  - It happens once. A later start never overwrites what JeanZ has since
    written, and a copy that fails part way leaves nothing behind, so the next
    start tries again instead of treating a half-copy as finished.
  - Every step is best effort. A failure leaves JeanZ with the empty state it
    would have had anyway and never stops it from starting.

- **Pinned sessions get the same context menu as every other session row.** A
  right-click on a pinned row offered one item, "Unpin from Project", while the
  identical session under its workspace offered the full menu. Renaming or
  archiving a pinned session meant finding it again somewhere else.
  - The pinned row now carries the shared session menu: open, rename, status,
    labels, pin/unpin, archive and delete.
  - Rename works inline on the row, exactly as it does in the tree.
  - Delete follows the removal preference, so it archives unless you have set
    it to delete for real.
  - Pinned rows come from several workspaces at once, so rename and removal
    now take their target per call. Rows that all share one workspace keep the
    simpler bound handlers.
  - Pinned rows still stay out of the canvas keyboard navigation, which counts
    workspace sections.

- **Remote connections: a login proxy is named instead of retried forever.** A
  remote Jean server behind an SSO proxy such as Cloudflare Access, Authelia,
  Authentik, Google IAP or oauth2-proxy left the desktop app reconnecting every
  ten seconds with no explanation.
  - The desktop app genuinely cannot sign in to one. Its page origin is
    `tauri://localhost`, so every call to the remote host is cross-origin and
    carries no cookies, and a WebView cannot put headers or cookies on a
    WebSocket handshake at all. A browser can, because there the page and the
    socket share the proxy's origin.
  - Jean now recognises the proxy: a real Jean server always answers
    `/api/auth` with JSON, for 200 and for 401 alike, so an HTML body or a
    redirect to another origin means something else replied.
  - The message says what to do — reach the server over a private network such
    as Cloudflare One/WARP or Tailscale, or open the URL in a browser, where
    the login works.
  - The ten-second auto-retry stops for this failure, since no retry can fix
    it. The manual Retry button stays.
  - Adding or editing such a connection is blocked while you are still in the
    dialog, next to an invalid token. Every other probe failure stays
    non-blocking, so a server that is merely offline can still be saved.
  - Browser web access is exempt: there the proxy's own session cookie works.

- **Global search: Sessions and Projects each get their own tab.** CMD+K had
  Quick and Search messages only, so sessions, projects, connections and every
  static command shared one list. Quick caps the sessions at eight and the rest
  is mixed in with commands, so the row you wanted was often truncated away or
  buried.
  - The **Sessions** tab lists every session across every project, newest
    activity first, with no cap and no commands mixed in. Unlike Quick it also
    lists the session you already have open.
  - The **Projects** tab lists every project, most recently opened first.
  - Both use the same rows Quick uses — backend icon, status, "time ago" for
    sessions; avatar and label for projects — and both filter the loaded data
    as you type. Only "Search messages" still asks the backend.
  - Tab cycles all four tabs and Shift+Tab cycles back; it used to flip
    between two. Clicking a tab still works, which is the route on mobile, and
    the tab strip wraps rather than squeezing in a narrow window.
  - The placeholder and the empty state name the tab you are in.
  - Opening a session from either tab goes through the same navigation as
    everywhere else, so the sidebar follows the jump.

### Changed

- **A session that finishes a run is Review, not Completed.** Sessions skipped
  the review state and landed in Completed on their own, so "Completed" said
  nothing about whether anyone had looked at the work.
  - A run that ends cleanly now reports as **Review ready**. `completed` is a
    manual status only: you pin it from the Set Status menu, or an agent pins it
    for its own session through the MCP `set_session_status` tool.
  - The unread bell and the command palette follow the same rule. They read
    "Review ready" for a finished run and keep the light-blue "Completed" for a
    pinned one.
  - A pinned Completed no longer counts toward a worktree's review tally on the
    project canvas, and no longer pulls the worktree summary back to review. You
    marked it done, so it is done.
  - `cancelled`, `crashed` and the live states are untouched.

- **The base session carries a "Base Session" badge everywhere.** A base
  session is named after the default branch, so the sidebar listed it as an
  ordinary workspace called `main`, while the project canvas dropped the name
  and printed `Base Session` in its place. The same session went by two names,
  and neither surface told you what the other one meant.
  - Both now show the branch name followed by the same small **Base Session**
    pill. The sidebar drops the pill below 200px of width, where the row has no
    room, the way it already drops the last-active time and the labels.
  - Screen readers keep the wording: the canvas row and its drag handle read
    "Open main (Base Session)" and "Reorder main (Base Session)".

- **Session context menu: "Set Status" is now "Status."** The verb added
  nothing next to the neighbouring rows.

- **Sidebar: a row fades after two days, not seven.** A finished session six
  days old still rendered at full weight, long past the point where it is
  worth scanning. The threshold is now 48 hours, which lines up with the age
  label: everything reading "2d ago" or older is faded, everything reading
  "1d ago" or newer is not.

- **The sidebar now follows a command-palette jump.** Opening a session with
  CMD+K moved the main area but left the tree behind: the previous selection
  stayed highlighted, the target's project and workspace could still be
  collapsed, and a row further down the list was never scrolled to. You saw a
  session with no idea where it lived.
  - Every programmatic jump — the palette, the unread bell, the Home view —
    now selects the target workspace, opens the folders above the project, the
    project itself and the workspace, and scrolls the session row into view.
  - The scroll uses `block: 'nearest'`, so a row already on screen does not
    move, and it follows the system "reduce motion" setting.
  - One reveal per jump. Scrolling away afterwards is never undone.
  - Picking a project in the palette opens the folders above it and scrolls to
    its row. The project's own subtree is left as you had it.
  - The mobile drawer gets the same behavior, since it renders the same tree.

- **Sidebar: the "Pinned" block is now a tree row like any other.** Its parent
  was a small uppercase caption, so it broke the alignment of the workspace
  rows directly below it, and its sessions were indented differently from
  ordinary session rows.
  - The parent takes the workspace row's geometry — the same height, padding,
    indent (including the narrow-sidebar indent) and full-width hover.
  - It expands and collapses with the same chevron as a workspace row, and
    that expansion is remembered across restarts, per project.
  - While collapsed it carries the same count badge a collapsed workspace row
    carries.
  - The pinned sessions now match session rows exactly, and the bespoke
    separator line under the block is gone — spacing comes from being a row.
  - The row is a button, so Enter and Space open and close it. It still stays
    out of the canvas keyboard index, which counts workspace sections.
  - The canvas variant of the block is untouched.

### Fixed

- **A renamed or restored session updates everywhere at once.** Renaming a
  session refreshed only its own workspace list, so the Home view's Recent
  sessions, the command palette and now the Starred section kept the old name
  for up to five minutes. Restoring an archived session had the same gap.
  Both now refresh the list those views share.

- **The development build no longer writes to the installed app's data.** The
  data directory stopped following the bundle identifier so that JeanZ and
  stable Jean could share one set of projects, sessions and CLI logins. That
  swept in `bun run tauri dev`, which had always had its own profile: a debug
  run read and wrote the real data and raced the installed app over the same
  unlocked JSON files.
  - The development identifier is now the one build held apart. Release flavors
    such as JeanZ still share stable Jean's directory, which is the point.
  - `JEAN_DATA_DIR` still overrides both, for an isolated profile.
  - First-start seeding is held apart the same way. The development build had
    counted as a flavor, so its first launch copied stable Jean's WebView
    store — which holds the remote-connection list, access tokens included —
    into its own.

- **The activity feed keeps one row per session instead of one per turn.** A
  run is one chat turn, not one session, so a long session appended "Session
  finished" on every turn and pushed the commits, pull requests and reviews the
  feed exists to show out of the 500-record log within an afternoon.
  - A session now holds a single row, carrying its latest outcome. A session
    that finished and was then cancelled reads as cancelled, not both.
  - Records that share one second are no longer returned oldest-first. A commit
    and the pull request opened from it are written in the same second, and the
    feed had shown them in reverse.

- **A server behind TLS is no longer mistaken for an SSO login proxy.** The
  check treated any redirect that left the origin as a login proxy, and a
  redirect from `http://host:8080` to `https://host:8080` leaves the origin.
  A healthy server entered over `http://` was therefore reported as sitting
  behind a proxy, and — because that verdict blocks saving — could not be added
  at all.
  - The host is compared now, not the whole origin. A real login proxy answers
    from another host, such as `team.cloudflareaccess.com`. A scheme or port
    change on the same host is an ordinary redirect.

- **Sidebar: a project row no longer collapses on a click.** Clicking a
  workspace row left its open/closed state alone — only the chevron changed it
  — but clicking a project row expanded or collapsed the project. The two row
  types look the same and sit in the same tree, so the same click gave two
  different results, and a project collapsed by accident whenever you only
  meant to click the row.
  - A click on a project row now opens the project canvas, whether the project
    has workspaces or not. It was the behavior of an empty project already, and
    a project that has workspaces had no row to click its way in.
  - The chevron is the only control for expand and collapse, for projects and
    for workspaces alike. Double-click to rename and the context menu are
    unchanged.

- **Context menus: submenu rows now match the rows above and below them.** The
  "Status" and "Labels" rows in the session context menu are submenu triggers,
  not plain menu items, and the shared `ContextMenuSubTrigger` was missing the
  icon and spacing rules that `ContextMenuItem` carries. Their icons stayed at
  full foreground colour while every sibling icon was faded, and their text sat
  8px to the left of the text on every other row.
  - The sub-trigger now uses the same `gap-2`, faded-icon and icon-size rules
    as a menu item, so the labels line up and the icons share one tone.
  - The chevron on the right is now faded as well, to match the leading icons.
  - The "Run" submenu on a worktree with several run scripts is corrected by
    the same change.

- **macOS stops re-asking JeanZ for access to other apps' data.** JeanZ shipped
  the stable `com.jean.desktop` bundle identifier, but it is signed by a
  different Developer ID team than Jean. macOS records a privacy grant against
  the bundle identifier _and_ the code signature it saw, so each app failed the
  requirement the other had stored: the dialog "JeanZ.app would like to access
  data from other apps" came back on every launch, and allowing it invalidated
  stable Jean's grant in turn.
  - JeanZ now ships `com.jean.desktop.jeanz`. Each app gets its own privacy
    record, so one grant sticks.
  - The data stays shared. The desktop app no longer takes its data directory
    from the bundle identifier — it calls `jean_core::resolve_data_dir()`,
    which returns the platform data directory plus a constant. Projects,
    sessions, worktrees, preferences and CLI logins are untouched, and no
    install has to migrate.
  - `JEAN_DATA_DIR` now also overrides that directory for the desktop app, not
    only for the headless host, which is how an isolated profile is made.
  - Project avatars and pasted images keep loading: the asset protocol scope
    follows the identifier, so the shared directory is granted by its real path
    at startup.
  - Nothing is lost in the move. On its first start JeanZ copies stable Jean's
    WebView store and plugin state across, so it opens looking exactly like the
    app it was built from — same theme, same zoom, same client preferences,
    same remote connections, same window geometry. Only the log directory is
    left behind, which nobody misses.
  - A locally built JeanZ is ad-hoc signed, so its code hash changes on every
    build and no grant can stick for it. Only a Developer ID build has a stable
    identity.

- **Sidebar: the scrollbar no longer covers the session timestamp.** A session
  row carried left padding only, so its "time ago" text ended flush with the
  sidebar edge and the scrollbar thumb was drawn on top of it once the list
  grew long enough to scroll.
  - The session row now keeps the same `pr-2` as the workspace row above it,
    so both end at the same place.
  - The tree's scroll container reserves a lane for the scrollbar
    (`scrollbar-gutter: stable`), so nothing is drawn over the row and the
    tree no longer shifts sideways the moment the list starts to overflow.

- **Project canvas: labels you created but assigned to nobody now survive a
  restart.** The canvas keeps a per-project label registry so a label stays in
  the picker after you take it off the last worktree. The frontend wrote that
  registry into `project_canvas_settings.<project>.labels`, but the Rust
  `ProjectCanvasSettings` struct had no such field, and serde drops unknown
  fields — so every save discarded it.
  - A label you created and then unassigned disappeared from the picker on the
    next start, and a colour change was lost with it. The registry rebuilt
    itself from the labels still on worktrees, which made the loss look like
    the label had never been created.
  - Rust now carries `labels` next to `pinned_labels`, with the same
    `#[serde(default)]` and empty-list skip, so old state files still load and
    a project without labels writes no extra key.
  - Pinned labels were never affected; they always had a Rust field.

## [0.1.73-z.3] - 2026-09-09

Built on Jean 0.1.73.

### Added

- **Title bar: a Usage button that shows plan limits in place.** Plan limits for
  Claude, Codex and Grok were only visible in Settings → Usage, which covers the
  whole app for a glance at a percentage. A chart button now sits in the left
  title bar, after Settings, and opens the same pane in a popover under it.
  - The popover shows every installed and signed-in backend, with the same
    progress bars, plan names, reset times and Refresh button as the Settings
    pane.
  - A "Settings" button in its header opens Settings on the Usage pane, for the
    times you want the full-height view.
  - The usage figures load only while the popover is open, and they are shared
    with the dock's usage badge, so opening it asks the backends for nothing
    they were not already asked.
  - The dock usage dropdown is unchanged. It follows the active session, while
    the title bar button is always in reach.

- **Files sidebar: a context menu on file and folder rows.** A row could only
  be left-clicked into Jean's internal viewer. A right-click now gives Open,
  Open in your editor, Open in Default App, Reveal in Finder, Open in Terminal
  (folders only), Add to Chat, Copy Path and Copy Relative Path.
  - "Reveal in Finder" selects the target inside its parent folder. Windows
    shows it in Explorer. Linux opens the parent folder, because it has no
    portable flag to select a file.
  - "Open in Default App" hands the file to the application the operating
    system has registered for it, so images and PDFs no longer open in a code
    editor.
  - "Add to Chat" puts the row into the composer as an `@mention` and attaches
    the file, the same as the `@` popover does.
  - Items that need a host shell are hidden in web access. Open, Add to Chat
    and the two copy items stay available.

### Fixed

- **JeanZ keeps its own UI state, so stable Jean can no longer erase it.** JeanZ
  shares one app-data directory with stable Jean on purpose, so both builds
  read and write the same files. They do not share a `UIState` schema: a build
  that does not know a field drops that field when it saves, which silently
  deleted the newer build's state. Workspace expansion, added in JeanZ first,
  disappeared on every restart for anyone who also ran stable Jean.
  - JeanZ now uses `ui-state_jeanz.json`; stable Jean keeps `ui-state.json`.
  - On its first start JeanZ reads the shared file once, so the window layout,
    drafts and expansion carry over. Every later save goes to the JeanZ file.
  - The flavor is recognised from the build config and from the `.app` bundle
    name, so both signals must miss before a JeanZ build is read as stable Jean.
  - Projects, sessions, preferences and CLI logins are still shared, which is
    the point of the shared directory.

- **Sidebar: "Completed" and "Cancelled" session statuses now change the row.**
  Setting a session to Completed had no visible effect, and Cancelled did not
  move the row out of the Review section. Three causes were corrected:
  - Completed shared the green indicator with "Review ready". It now has its own
    light-blue dot, in the sidebar as well as in the unread bell and the command
    palette.
  - Completed, Cancelled, Review and Crashed all shared one "Review" section.
    Completed and Cancelled each get their own sidebar section now. Crashed stays
    under Review, because it still needs attention.
  - A pinned Completed or Cancelled status was discarded while a session waited
    for a plan approval or an answer, so the pin did nothing. A pinned terminal
    status now wins over a waiting status. It still does not hide a run that is
    in flight, scheduled, or crashed.
